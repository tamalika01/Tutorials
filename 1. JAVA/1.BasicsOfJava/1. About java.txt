    What is java?
	-- Java is a high level general purpose programming language, used for developing web applications,
	  android applications, and other business applications.

  	#### Features of java ####
	- High level-
	       high level language are understandable by human being, low level language are understandable by computer. 
	-object oriented language-
	       provide the option to create class and all the oops features.
	- plateform independent
	       because we can write and compile java class in one platform and then can run in any platform...WORA
	- automatic memory clean up by java garbage collector	   
	- highly secured, does not use pointers
	- used in web, app development.

#### How java code runs internally ####
	- jdk ( java development kit ) 
		It contains all tools needed to write, compile, debug and run java code. It include javac, jvm ,jre,
		binary files needed to run java program.
	-jvm ( java virtual machine ) 
		It is abstract machine and provides run time enviornment to execute java bytecode. jvm communicates with os hardware and      so it is plateform dependent. we need different versions of jvm on different os. To run bytecode on any 
		machine we will only need jvm for that machine.
	- jre (java run enviornment ) 
		It is an implementation of jvm. we need jre to run any java program as it provides run time enviornment for execution of 
		program.
		
	- To run the java code:
		a. Write the java program and save it with .java extension say Tmp.java
		b. Compile it into bytecode, javac Tmp.java arg1 arg2 
		c. After this step we have .class file which is bytecode fil and independent of os.
		d. Run it on jvm, java FileName arg1 arg2 arg3
