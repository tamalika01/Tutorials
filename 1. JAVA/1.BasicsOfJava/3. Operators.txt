### Operators ###

--- Symbols that tell compiler to perform some operation.
-- 1+2 // + is operator and 1,2 are operands

1. Arithmetic Operators:
     --Binary:  Operations performed on two operands. eg-  +, -, *, /, %
     --Unary:   Operations performed on singe operand eg-  ++(increment), --(decrement)

     Increment are of two types:
     1. Pre-increment:  ++a
              step 1- change value
              step 2- use value

     2. Post-increment:  a++
              step 1- use value
              step 2- change value

    same as decrement

2. Relational Operators: 
       --create a relation between two operands. eg- ==, <, >, <=, >=, !=
       -- always returns output as boolean that is true or false

3. Logical Operators:
       &&  - logical and
       || - logical or
       ! - logical not

4. Binary Number System(Base 2):
        1. Decimal to Binary
        2. Binary to decimal

5. Octal Systems(base 8)

6.Hexadecimal Systems(base 16)

7. Bitwise Operators:
       &(Binary AND), |(Binary OR), ^ (Binary One's Complement), <<(Binary left shift), >> (Binary right shift)

8. Assignment Operators:
      =, +=, *=, /=
