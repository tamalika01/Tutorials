e#### Output ###
  1. System.out.print("Hello World");
     This will print msg but not insert a new line

  2. System.out.println("Hello World");
     This will print msg and also insert a new line at end

  System is a class, print is a function

### Data Types ###
  - Java is a typed language.
  - Typed languages are the languages in which we define the type of data type and it will be known by machine at the compile-time or at runtime.

- Data types are of two types.
   1. Primitive (total 8):
    byte (1byte), short(2byte), int (4byte), long (8byte) // all 4 used to store integer value, based on range use one 

    float(4byte) , double (8byte) // both used to store floating point value, based on range use one

    char (1byte)    // used to store 1 char

    boolean (1byte) // used to store 2 values either true or false.

   2.Non Primitive: String, Array, Class, Array, Interface

### Input ###
--Java util.Scanner class provides method to take input

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);//create object of sc and  taken input from user 
String name = sc.nextLine(); // store the input in name
---nextLine, nextInt, nextDouble.....

-- At the end close the Scanner
        scanner.close()

#### Variables #######
  - Variables are used to store values in memory.
  - Create:
    1st way : 
      type name;    // default value will be stored in name Variable since we are not providing. 
    2nd way:
      type name = value;  // create a variable with this value.
    3rd way:
      type name1 = value1, name2 = value2;  // create many variable of same type in one go.

  - type can be int, float, boolean, double etc and name we can keep anything.


  ####### Operators #########
    - Arithmetic:
      +, -, *, /, % (a%b = remainder when a will be divided by b)

    - Assignment operator:
      a=b // assign value of b to a, now both a and b have same value.

    - Comparison operator
      - Returns either true or false, used in if/else, loops to test
      - > , >= , <, <=, ==, !=
    
##### Type casting #####
  - It means to change the type of variable.
  - 2 types:
    1. Implicit typecast:
      typecast automatic performed by compiler internally.
      int a= 5, int b=3;
      int c=a/b;  // result of a/b will be 5/3 some thing 1.666... which is float, compiler internall will change it to int, which is 1, so c=1.

    2. Explicit typecast:
        We have to typecast mannually in our program.
        e.g double a = 8.0;
            int b = (int) a;
