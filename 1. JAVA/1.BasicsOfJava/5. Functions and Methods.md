# Functions 
- Functions is a block of code which takes input and returns output by doing some operations.
- A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. 

- syntax: 
   - ```java
       return-type function_name (parameter 1, parameter2,  …… parameter n){  //function_body 
       } 
       return-type 
       ```  

- The return type of a function is the data type of the variable that that function  returns.

## 1. function_name :
- It is the unique name of that function.  
- It is always recommended to declare a function before it is used. 

## 2. Parameters : 
- A function can take some parameters as inputs. These parameters are specified  along with their data types. 
     - For eg- if we are writing a function to add 2 integers, the parameters would be  passed like – 
               `int add (int num1, int num2)`

## 3. main function :  
- The main function is a special function as the computer starts running the code  from the beginning of the main function. 
     Main function serves as the entry  point for the program.
