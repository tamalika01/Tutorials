 ## 1. Arithmetic Operators:
- Binary:  Operations performed on two operands. `+, -, *, /, %`
- Unary:   Operations performed on single operand eg-  `++(increment), --(decrement)`
- Increment/decrement are of two types:
     1. Pre-increment or pre-decrement:  ++a or --a.
          - step 1- change value
          - step 2- use value
          - e.g int a =5; print (++a) will print 6 because first a value will be changed and then used.

     2. Post-increment:  a++
          - step 1- use value
          - step 2- change value
          - e.g int a=5; print(a++) will print 5 becuase first a value will be use in print which is 5 then it's value will be increase.

## 2. Relational Operators: 
- create a relation between two operands. eg- ==, <, >, <=, >=, !=
-  always returns output as boolean that is true or false

## 3. Logical Operators:
- &&  - logical and
- || - logical or
- ! - logical not

## 4. Bitwise Operators:
- &(Binary AND), |(Binary OR), ^ (Binary One's Complement), <<(Binary left shift), >> (Binary right shift)

## 5. Assignment Operators:
- =, +=, *=, /=
