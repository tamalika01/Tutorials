### Functions ###
-- Functions is a block of code which takes input and returns output by doing some operations.
-- A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. 

--syntax: 
    return-type function_name (parameter 1, parameter2,  …… parameter n){  //function_body 
    } 
    return-type  

    --The return type of a function is the data type of the variable that that function  returns.

1.function_name :
     --It is the unique name of that function.  
     --It is always recommended to declare a function before it is used. 

2. Parameters : 
      A function can take some parameters as inputs. These parameters are specified  along with their data types. 
      For eg- if we are writing a function to add 2 integers, the parameters would be  passed like – 
               int add (int num1, int num2)

3.main function :  
     The main function is a special function as the computer starts running the code  from the beginning of the main function. 
     Main function serves as the entry  point for the program.
