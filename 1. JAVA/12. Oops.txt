################## Basic concept of OOPS ####################################

## OOPs: 
    Object Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
    Advantage of OOPs programming model:
        a. Using OOPs we can quickly develop our application as it is very easy to relate programming objects with real world objects.
        b. Increaase security of data members using concept of encapsulation
        c. Provide features to reuse code using inheritance, so easy to maintain.    

## Class: 
    - It is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its functions. Class is the only logical representation of the data.
      For example, Human being is a class. The body parts of a human being are its properties, and the actions performed by the body parts
      are known as functions. The class does not occupy any memory space till the time an object is instantiated.
    - syntax:
        <access speicifier> class <className> {
            // code of this class
        }

## Object: 
    - It is a run-time entity. It is an instance of the class. An object can represent a person, place or any other item. An object can operate  on both data members and member functions. 
    - When an object is created using a new keyword, then space is allocated for the variable in a heap, and the starting address is stored in the stack memory.

## Members of class
    - A class contains 2 members.
        i. Data (variables)
        ii. methods

## type of members 
    - Each variables and method is either belongs to instance or class.
    - instance variable is available to only a single particualr instance.
        // declare
        int a; float b; String name;
        void methodName(){

        }

        // access (read value)
        obj.a 
        obj.methodName();

        // set 
        obj.a = newVAlue;

    - class members(variable, method) is available to all instance
        // declare  
        static int a=2; static String schoolName = "MCET";
        static int add(){}, static void main() {};

        // access (read)
        ClassName.a, ClassName.schoolName;
        obj.a, obj.schoolName (not recommended)

## this keyword 
    - Inside instance method (any method which is not static),java provides a special variable this which refers to current obj.
    - use?
        to read and set instance variables.
        obj.varName;
        obj.varName = newValue;

        void anyInstanceMethod(){
            this.varName // read
            this.varName = newValue; //set
        }


## Constructors
    - Constructor is a special method which is used to initiliase an object. i.e this is a spcial method which will automatically 
    called when an object of that class is created using new keyword.
    - It does not return anything like other methods
    - It must have same name as of class name.
    - sntax:
        <access spcecifier> ClassName(args..){
            // write code which will be executed each time an object will be created.
        }
    - we can create as many Constructor as we want, condition is each Constructor's argument must be different.

    - default Constructor
        - In java, if we don't define any Constructor then java provided us a Constructor which does nothing
        - ClassName();
        - if you write atleast one Constructor then it will not provide you default Constructor.

################### 4 Basic pillars of oops #######################################
    1. Inheritance
    2. Encapsulation
    3. Abstraction
    4. Polymorphism

## Inheritance:
       --Inheritance is a feature in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically. 
        In such a way, we can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other classes. 

       --In Java, the class which inherits the members of another class is called derived class and the class whose
          members are inherited is called  base class. The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.

       -- Types of Inheritance : 
            1. Single inheritance : When one class inherits another class, it is known as single level inheritance 
                            class Shape {
                               public void print() {
                                    System.out.println("I am  a shape object");
                               }
                            }

                            class Triangle extends Shape{   
                                public void area(int h, int b) {
                                     System.out.println((1/2)*b*h);
                                }  
                            }

                            // DRY rule - don't repeat yourself

     2. Hierarchical inheritance : Hierarchical inheritance is defined as the process of deriving more than one class from a base class. 
                                   class Shape {
                                      public void area() {
                                            System.out.println("Displays Area of Shape");
                                      }
                                    }
                                  class Triangle extends Shape {
                                      public void area(int h, int b) {
                                           System.out.println((1/2)*b*h);
                                       }  
                                  }
                                  class Circle extends Shape {
                                       public void area(int r) {
                                             System.out.println((3.14)*r*r);
                                        }
                                  }


     3. Multilevel inheritance : Multilevel inheritance is a process of deriving a class from another derived class. 
                                 class Shape {
                                     public void area() {
                                         System.out.println("Displays Area of Shape");
                                     }
                                }
                                class Triangle extends Shape {
                                      public void area(int h, int b) {
                                        System.out.println((1/2)*b*h);
                                      }  
                                }
                                class EquilateralTriangle extends Triangle {
                                       int side;
                                }

     4. Hybrid inheritance : Hybrid inheritance is a combination of simple, multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance. 

     5. Multiple Inheritance: when child class inherits from more than one class. 
        class Child extends Parent1 extends Parent2 {}
        This is not supported in java.


## Packages:
     Package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages. Packages can be built-in or user defined.
     Built-in packages - java, util, io etc.

    eg- import java.util.Scanner;
        import java.io.IOException;


## Access Modifiers in Java:
      1. Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.

      2. Default: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. 
                  If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.

      3. Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class.
                     If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.

      4. Public: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, 
                 within the package and outside the package

                 package newpackage;
                 class Account {
                    public String name;
                    protected String email;
                    private String password;


                    public void setPassword(String password) {
                    this.password = password;
                    }
                }
                public class Sample {
                 public static void main(String args[]) {
                   Account a1 = new Account();
                   a1.name = "Apna College";
                   a1.setPassword("abcd");
                   a1.email = "hello@apnacollege.com";
                
                 }
                }


## Encapsulation :
       -- Encapsulation is the process of combining data and functions into a single unit called class. In Encapsulation, the data is not accessed directly; it is accessed through the functions present inside the class.

       -- In simpler words, make datea members (variables) of the class are kept private and public getter and setter methods are provided to manipulate these attributes. Thus, encapsulation makes the concept of data hiding possible.(Data hiding: a language feature to restrict access to members of an object, reducing the negative effect due to dependencies.
       e.g. "protected", "private" feature in Java). 


## Abstraction :
    --Abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details & showing only the essential parts/functionalities to the user.

    --Advantage of abstraction is that it makes our system easy and less complext to use.

    e.g you know that when you press start button in car, it will start engine. A driver need to know only this information, he did not
    need to know how internall fuel is converting into enery and engine is runing

    -- Data binding : Data binding is a process of binding the application UI and business logic. Any change made in the business logic will reflect directly to the application UI. 

     Abstraction is achieved in 2 ways :
         1.Abstract class
         2. Interfaces (Pure Abstraction)

     ## Abstract Class:
             1. An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
             2. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
             3. It cannot be instantiated.
             4. It can have constructors and static methods also.
             5. It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.


    ## Interfaces:
          1. All the fields in interfaces are public, static and final by default.
          2. All methods are public & abstract by default.
          3. A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.
          4. Interfaces support the functionality of multiple inheritance.


## Polymorphism:
         Polymorphism is the ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types).
         With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data.
         Precisely, Poly means ‘many’ and morphism means ‘forms’.

    Types of Polymorphism --
        1. Compile Time Polymorphism (Static) 
        2. Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic) 

        1. Compile Time Polymorphism : The polymorphism which is implemented at the compile time is known as compile-time polymorphism. 
                                       Example - Method Overloading 
            Method Overloading : Method overloading is a technique which allows you to have more than one function with the
                                 same function name  but with different functionality. Method overloading can be possible on the following basis: 
                                1. The type of the parameters passed to the function. 
                                2. The number of parameters passed to the function.

                class Student {
                        String name;
                        int age;
                        public void displayInfo(String name) {
                        System.out.println(name);
                        }
                   public void displayInfo(int age) {
                   System.out.println(age);
                   }
                   public void displayInfo(String name, int age) {
                   System.out.println(name);
                   System.out.println(age);
                   }
                }

         2. Runtime Polymorphism : Runtime polymorphism is also known as dynamic polymorphism. Function overriding is an example of runtime     polymorphism. Function overriding means when the child class contains the method which is already present in the parent class. Hence, the child class overrides the method of the parent class. In case of function overriding, parent and child classes both contain the same function with a different definition. The call to the function is determined at runtime is known as runtime polymorphism.

                                class Shape {
                                  public void area() {
                                  System.out.println("Displays Area of Shape");
                                  }
                                }
                                class Triangle extends Shape {
                                  public void area(int h, int b) {
                                  System.out.println((1/2)*b*h);
                                }  
                                }
                                class Circle extends Shape {
                                    public void area(int r) {
                                    System.out.println((3.14)*r*r);
                                   }  
                                }
