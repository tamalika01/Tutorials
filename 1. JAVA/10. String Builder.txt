### String Builder ###

-- Strings in Java are immutable ie. it cannot be changed.

1. Declaration--
     StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Apna College");
     System.out.println(sb);

2. Get A Character from Index--
      StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Tony");
     //Set Char
     System.out.println(sb.charAt(0));

3. Set a Character at Index--
     StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Tony");
     //Get Char
     sb.setCharAt(0, 'P'); // 0 is the index of which we have to change, p is the character that we will input
     System.out.println(sb);

4. Insert a character at some index--
      sb.insert(0, 'S'); // 0 is the index we want to put the character S
     System.out.println(sb);

5. Delete the character--
     sb.delete(0, 1);
     System.out.println(sb);

6. Append a char--
     sb.append(" Stark");
     System.out.println(sb);
