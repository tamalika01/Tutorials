# Interface

## Definition:
- Interface is just like a class, which contains only abstract methods. To achieve interface, java provides a word called implements.

## Note:
- 1. Interface methods are public and abstract by default.
  2. Interface variables are public + static + final by default.
  3. Inteface methods must be overridden inside the implementing class.
  4. Interface nothing but deals between client and developer.

## Example:
```java
package Advanced;
import java.util.*;

interface Location{
void input();
void output();
}
class Client implements Location {
	String name, address;
	public void input() {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter your name: ");
		 name = sc.nextLine();
		
		System.out.println("Enter your address: ");
		 address = sc.nextLine();
	}
	public void output() {
		System.out.println(  "Client name is: "+ name+ " who lives in " +  address);
	}
public static void main(String args[]) {
	Location l = new Client();
	l.input();
	l.output();
	
}
}

```
