####  Time Complexity ####

--Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm 
  to run as a function of the length of the input. 

--Types of notations :

        1. O-notation: It is used to denote asymptotic upper bound. 
                       For a given function g(n), we denote it by O(g(n)). Pronounced as “big-oh of g of n”. 
                       It is also known as worst case time complexity as it denotes the upper bound in which the algorithm terminates.

         2. Ω-notation: It is used to denote asymptotic lower bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by Ω(g(n)). 
                        Pronounced as “big-omega of g of n”. It is also known as best case time complexity as it denotes the lower bound 
                        which the algorithm terminates.

        3. 𝚯-notation: It is used to denote the average time of a program. 


--Comparison of functions on the basis of time complexity 
      It follows the following order in case of time complexity: 
       O(nn) > O(n!) > O(n3) > O(n2) > O(n.log(n)) > O(n.log(log(n))) > O(n) > O(sqrt(n)) > O(log(n)) > O(1) 
     Note: Reverse is the order for better performance of a code with corresponding time complexity, 
           i.e. a program with less time complexity is more efficient. 
           
#### Space Complexity #### 
        --Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by a program to run 
          as a function of length of the input. It is directly proportional to the largest memory your program
          acquires at any instance during run time. 
          For example: int consumes 4 bytes of memory.
