## Tell me about a new feauture and a bug that you have solved.
- Bug: I have created a register page IPD-blood-request-register, there is a column named as Request details. 
from the database the value is coming to the column is 4-5 components of blood like wb,pcb,rdp etc and it is showing comma seperated.
so the width of the column is extended automatically. but it is not looking good. so i fixed this bug by using the Replace function.
that when comma is located then relace it with the br tag.

- Features: I have created Donor registration page, where donor details is being filled. binded data in register page like donor register.
then created modals in many register pages for preparing the blood components, showing the donor counselling questions and answers.
issued the bag for blood. blocked blood for crossmatch.
