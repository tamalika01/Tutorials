##  1. Why Should We Hire You?
```
Sir/ Ma’am, 

As you must have figured from my resumé that I am a fresher in this line of work. However, I believe this puts 
me at an advantage as I will bring to your company the urge and the dedication to learn new things and put them 
to use. 

I may not possess the practical knowledge in this field.
However, throughout college, I persisted in learning in-depth about the topics and developed a deep theoretical 
understanding of important topics used in this field and can use this knowledge to contribute here.
```

```
Sir/Ma’am,

I have recently completed a 6-month internship as a C# ASP.NET Developer, where I worked on real-world projects 
and gained hands-on experience in developing and maintaining web applications. This experience has strengthened 
my practical knowledge of ASP.NET, C#, SQL Server, and web development while also improving my problem-solving and teamwork skills.

During my internship, I actively contributed to project development, learned best coding practices, and adapted
 to an agile work environment. I am eager to apply these skills in a full-time role and continue learning to contribute 
 effectively to your organization.

My dedication to continuous learning, combined with my internship experience and strong theoretical foundation,
 makes me confident that I can add value to your team.
```

    I am also a harworking and a dedicated person. whenever i take a task, I dedicate it to complete.

    I have little problem in public speaking. However I am taking the steps like taking the role of speaker in
    college annual functions to overcome this issue as i believe this is one of the essentials skills to have.
```

```
Strengths:
    1. I am a quick learner and always take the initiative to ask questions and explore solutions to enhance my understanding.
    2. I am hardworking and dedicated—once I take on a task, I ensure it is completed efficiently and with attention to detail.

Weakness:
    1.I used to work on tasks alone, thinking it was faster. But during my internship, I learned that teamwork 
    and sharing tasks make work more efficient. Now, I make sure to ask for help, share ideas,
     and collaborate better with my team.
```
## 3. Do you have any questions for us?
```
Yes sure,
I have couple of questions:
1. I would like to know what qualities you look for in a fresher applying for this position.

```

```

I have couple of questions:
1. What would be my day to day responsibilities in the current role.
2. Can you provide a little feedback on my interview and some suggestions on areas where i can improve?
```
## 4. Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
```
In 10 years, I see myself in a leadership position at your firm. I’m hoping to not only gain more knowledge 
in my domain but also become an inspiration to my subordinates. I want to be able to mentor or guide people. 
Hence, being in a leadership position will help me achieve this goal.
```

## 5. Are you a team player?
```
Yes, I am a strong team player. During my internship at Cludo Technology, 
I collaborated with a team of developers to build and enhance ASP.NET applications. 
This experience helped me understand the importance of clear communication, knowledge sharing, 
and collective problem-solving in a professional setting.

I actively contributed by writing efficient C# code, optimizing SQL queries, and assisting 
teammates in debugging issues. I also believe in learning from others and helping when needed, 
which fosters a productive work environment.

At Cognizant, I am eager to work in a collaborative environment where I can contribute my
 skills while also growing with the team.

## 7. Why do you want to join Cognizant?

 digital transformation, and cutting-edge technologies. As a B.Tech (CSE) 2024 graduate, I am eager to start
  my career in an organization that provides a dynamic learning environment, diverse projects, and opportunities
   to work on real-world solutions.

Cognizant’s strong presence in software development, cloud computing, AI, and digital solutions aligns perfectly 
with my skills in C#, ASP.NET, and SQL, which I gained during my internship at Cludo Technology. The company’s
