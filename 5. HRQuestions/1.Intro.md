Good morning Sir/Ma'am,

First of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity to interview.

As part of my contributions, I successfully implemented key features in multiple modules, which includes:
  1. Implementing donor and recipient management in the Blood Bank Module,
  2. Developed the ticketing process in the Ticket Management System,
  3. and developed seamless student registration in the Student Examination Portal.

Talking about my Technical Skills, I have a strong command of Backend Technologies including C#, ASP.NET, Java, SQL Server and Git. I also have good knowledge of frontend Technologies: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript

Additionally, I have completed a comprehensive front-end certification program from Team Meta on Coursera, which reflects my dedication to continuous learning and professional growth.
