# Introduction

Good morning Sir/Ma'am,
First of all thank you for providing me an opportunity for the interview.

My name is Tamalika Chowdhury. I am from Chakdaha, Nadia, West Bengal.

I have completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Murshidabad College of Engineering 
and Technology with 8.93 cgpa till 8th semester. I have done class 12 from Chakdaha Ramlal Academy with 
74% in 2019. I have done class 10 from Chakdaha Basanta Kumari Balika Vidyapith with 87% in 2017.

Talking about my technical skills, I have a good knowledge in c#, asp.net, java, sql servver, mongodb, git. I also have a 
solid understanding of front end technologies including html, css, bootstrap, javascript.

I've not only gained theoretical knowledge but also practical experience by creating projects. Moreover, I've completed a comprehensive front-end certification program from Team Meta on Coursera, showcasing my commitment to continuous learning and skill development. 
I applied my learning to create a web based project, Number Converter. Number Converter is a website which 
converts number from one format to another format. It supports the conversion from 
(binary, decimal, hexadecimal, octal) to (binary, decimal, hexadecimal, octal).

In my leisure time, I love to read story books and drawing.

So, this is all about me.
Thank you again Sir/Ma'am.
