# Exceptions:
- When executing C# code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, or other unforeseeable things.
- When an error occurs, C# will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: C# will throw an `exception` (throw an error).

# Try Catch Block:
- The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
- The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
- The try and catch keywords come in pairs.

- ```java
   try 
    {
       //  Block of code to try
    }
   catch (Exception e)
   {
       //  Block of code to handle errors
    }
  ```
- If an error occurs, we can use `try...catch` to catch the error and execute some code to handle it.
- ```java
  try
   {
     int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
     Console.WriteLine(myNumbers[10]);
   }
  catch (Exception e)
   {
     Console.WriteLine(e.Message); // or like this : Console.WriteLine("Something went wrong.");
   }
  ```

# Finally:
- The finally statement lets you execute code, after `try...catch`, regardless of the result:
- ```java
   try
    {
      int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
      Console.WriteLine(myNumbers[10]);
    }
   catch (Exception e)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Something went wrong.");
    }
   finally
    {
      Console.WriteLine("The 'try catch' is finished.");
    }
  ```

# Throw Keyword:
- The `throw ` statement allows you to create a custom error.
- The `throw` statement is used together with an `exception class`. There are many exception classes available in C#: `ArithmeticException`, `FileNotFoundException`, `IndexOutOfRangeException`, `TimeOutException`, etc:

- ```java
   static void checkAge(int age)
   {
     if (age < 18)
     {
       throw new ArithmeticException("Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.");
     }
     else
     {
       Console.WriteLine("Access granted - You are old enough!");
     }
   }

   static void Main(string[] args)
   {
     checkAge(15);
   }
  ```
