# Approach:
- At first map is empty, Then traverse the string and check every character thai it is present in the map or not. Like if already a character is present then string is not isogram as because we know if it is present it means it is repeating. 
  when fequency of every character will be 1 then only we can say the string is isogram.

# Code:
```java
static boolean isIsogram(String data){
        HashMap<Character,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i=0; i<data.length(); i++)
        {
            char ch = data.charAt(i);
            if(map.containsKey(ch))
                   map.put(ch,map.get(ch)+1);
                   return false;
            else
                  map.put(ch,1);
        }
        return true;
    }



```
