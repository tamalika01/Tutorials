# Q. find a to power b
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/power-of-numbers-1587115620/1

# Approach: 
- a to the power b, means a is multiplied b times. So let pow=1, now if we multiply a with pow, returns a only.
          now if we multiply pow with a it returns a number, pow is updated and stores the number. Again if we multiply 
          pow with a it returns a number ...like this we have to multiply pow with a , b times.

# Code:
```java
long power(int N,int R)
    {
       if(R==1)
       return N;
       if(R==0)
       return 1;
       long number=1;
      for(int i=1; i<=R; i++){
           number=(number*N);
      }
       return number;
      }
```



# Q. find sqrt of n
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/square-root/1

# Approach: 
- we have to find the sqrt of a number. like sqrt of 25 is 5, but if we do sqrt of 28, then also it should return 5.
          So atfirst keep going to check the sqr of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...it comes 25. but in case of 28, we have to check
          1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.. now 6*6=36, so 36>28, so we have to return the just previous number of sqrt of 36. which is 6,
          and previous number is 5.
          So if n is sqr number then returns the sqrt of n, if not, then return the nearset sqr of n and then sqrt it, then
          return the sqrt-1.

# Code:
```java
long floorSqrt(long x)
	 {
	    for(int i=1; i<=x+1; i++){
		 if((i*i)>x)
		 return i-1;
		}
		return 0;
	}
```
