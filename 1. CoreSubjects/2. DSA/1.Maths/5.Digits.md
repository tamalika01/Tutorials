# Q sum of digits
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-digits1742/1

# Approach:
-  At first take a sum variableand assign it to 0; If the number!=0 then we will proceed.
          12%10 = 2
          12/10 = 1
          if we divide a number by 10 then remainder comes the last digit and qoutient comes the remaining digits
          of that number. So again we have to divide the remaining digits by 10. It will continue.
          then add the digits.


# Code:
```java
static int sumOfDigits(int N) {
        // code here
        int sum = 0;
        while(N!=0){
            sum+= N%10;
            N/=10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
```



# Q reverse given number
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-digit0316/1

# Approach:  
- Reverse the n number. So let reverse number is ans. Initially ans=0, Now we can get the last digit of any number 
           by modulo with 10, then store it in ans. Then remove the digit from the number as it is already used from n by 
           dividing n by 10. Now we know that to add a new digit we have to do ans= ans*10+d, So mainly take one by one the
           digits from number, do modulo with 10, it return the last digit, then add it with the ans...like this the
           reverse number becomes.

# Code:
```java
public long reverse_digit(long n)
    {
        long sum=0;
        long temp=0;
        while(n!=0){
            temp=n%10;
            sum=sum*10+temp;
            n=n/10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
```
