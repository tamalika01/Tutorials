# Q. Check Wheather given number is even or odd
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/odd-or-even3618/1?utm_source=gfg&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=bottom_sticky_on_article

# Approach:
Suppose a number N, when it will be divided by 2 and remainder comes 0, then it is even, else it will be odd.
Now a trick is there, if the method is declared in string then we have to return it in a double quotation mark ""
	
	
# Code:
```java
static String oddEven(int N){
        // code here
        if(N%2==0){
       return "even";
        }
        else{
        return "odd";
        }
    }

```
