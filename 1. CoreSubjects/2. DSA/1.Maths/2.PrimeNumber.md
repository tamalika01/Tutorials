# Q. Check if a number is prime or not
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/prime-number2314/1

# Approach 1: 
- prime number- divisible by 1 and itself. At first we check N is lesser than or equal to 1, if it is..then it will 
            not a prime number. Then we stat checking from 2 to N-1. If N is divisible by 2 then it is not a prime number
            otherwise it becomes the prime number.

# Approach 2:  
- At first we check N is lesser than or equal to 1, if it is..then it will not a prime number. After that we are checking 
             from 2 to sqrt of N because the number when will not be divisible by sqrt of N then  N will not be
             divisible by any further number also. If N is divisible by 2 then it is not a prime number
            otherwise it becomes the prime number. But here we have written sqrt(N) like this:
            N=9, sqrt(N)=3
            ie. N=9, i*i<=N  ----> i*i<=9 ----> i<=3


# Code:
```java
static int isPrime(int N){
        // code here
       if(N<=1)
       return 0;                   // 0 means not a prime number, 1 means is a prime number.
        for(int i=2; i<=N-1; i++){
            if(N%i==0)
            return 0;
        }
        return 1;
    }
```

```java
static int isPrime(int N){
        // code here
       if(N<=1)
       return 0;
        for(int i=2; i*i<=N; i++){
            if(N%i==0)
            return 0;
        }
        return 1;
    }
```
