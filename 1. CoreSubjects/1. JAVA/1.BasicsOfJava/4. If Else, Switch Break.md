2. switch

## 1. if-else condition
- `if(expression)` syntax is used to make decison.
- expression inside if must always returns boolean.
- if it returns true, then code inside if will execute.
- if it returns false, then code inside if will not execute.
- Additonally we can put else (optional), so that if expression returns false, then code of else block is returned.
- code:
   ```java
   /*
   type1: use only if block, if condition (age is greater than 4 in this example) is true code of if will 
   execute other wise nothing happens.
   */
   if(age>5)
   {
      System.out.println("your age is greater than 5");
   }

    /*
   type2: We have option to add an else block if needed. suppose i want to print your age is less than 5 when user's age is less than 5. This we can add in else block.
   */
   if(age>5)
   {
      System.out.println("your age is greater than 5");
   }
   else 
   {
      System.out.println("Your age is less than 5");
   }

   /* 
   type3: We also have option to many else-if after if. Flow will be then like first if condition will be tested if it is true, then it's block of code will execute and others else-if code will be skiped.
   in case if block returns false, then next else-if will be tested. this will continue till end 
   */
   if(age>5)
   {
      print("age is greater than 5");
   }
   else-if(age>4)
   {
      print("age is greater than 4");
   }
   else-if(age>3)
   {
      print("age is greater than 3");
   }
   else
   {
      print("age is less than 3");
   }
   ```

## 2. switch-case expression
- switch-case statements are a substitute for long if statements that compare a variable to multiple values. -
- It simply takes an expression as input, evaluate the expression and directly call the matching case and all the case which is in down.
- if a match is found, it executes the corresponding code of that value case.
- code:
   ```java
   /*
   In below example case 2 and case3 will execute, because expression inside switch will give 2.
   */
   int a=1,b=3;
   switch(b-a)
   {
      case 1:
         // write code for this case, as many lines as you want. 
         // at then end write break because other wise all case below this case will also  execute.
         break;
      case 2:
         // codes
         break;
      case 3:
         // codes 
         break;
      default:
         // codes 
   }
   ```
