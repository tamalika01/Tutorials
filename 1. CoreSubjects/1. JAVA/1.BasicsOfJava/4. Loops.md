# 1. Loops Basic 
- A loop is used for executing a block of statements repeatedly until a particular  condition is satisfied. 
- A loop consists of an initialization statement, a test condition and an increment statement.

 ## 1. for loops
 - code :
    ```java
    // syntax
    for(intial value;condition;increment/decrement step)
    {
        // your logic code 
    }

    // e.g calculate sum till 10 
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i=0;i<=10;i++)
    {
        sum = sum + i;
    }
    ```

## 2. While Loops
- code :
    ```java
    // syntax 
    while(condition)
    {
        // your code logic 
    }

    // e.g code to calculate sum 
    int sum=0,i=0;
    while(i<=10)
    {
        sum = sum + i;
        i++;
    }
    ```
## 3.  do-while
- This is bit different than for loop and while loop.
- In this condition is checked after executing the code, so it gurantess that code in the do-while block will run at least 1 time.
- code 
    ```java
    // syntax 
    do 
    {
        // code in this block will run at least 1 time.
    } while(condition)
    ```

## 4. enhanced for loop 
- It is new feature of java se8.
- It is used to traverse arrays or collections (list set).
- code:
    ```java
    // task is to print all element of array 
    // approach1: use old way 
    for(int i=0; i < arr.lenth ; i++){
        System.out.println(arr[i]);
    }

    // approach2: use enhanced for loop 
    for(int ele : arr)
    {
        System.out.println(ele);
    }

    // Noticed how easy was that!
    // Basically in this syntax, you are not writing and condition to check or increment/decrement step. java will directly 
    // do that for you. so this loop will run n number of time if n is of array.
    // each time in variable ele, will be element of array.
    // for e.g if arr = {1,2,3};
    // loop willl run three time.
    // first time ele = 1
    // second time ele=2
    // third time ele=3
    ```
