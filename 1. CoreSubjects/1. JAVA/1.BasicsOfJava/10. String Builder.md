# String Builder

- Strings in Java are immutable ie. it cannot be changed.
- We have to return the StringBuilder in string.

## 1. Declaration--
```java
 StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Apna College");
System.out.println(sb);
```
    

## 2. Get A Character from Index--
```java
```
      StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Tony");
     //Set Char
     System.out.println(sb.charAt(0));

## 3. Set a Character at Index--
     StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Tony");
     //Get Char
     sb.setCharAt(0, 'P'); // 0 is the index of which we have to change, p is the character that we will input
     System.out.println(sb);

## 4. Insert a character at some index--
      sb.insert(0, 'S'); // 0 is the index we want to put the character S
     System.out.println(sb);

## 5. Delete the character--
     sb.delete(0, 1);
     System.out.println(sb);

## 6. Append a char--
     sb.append(" Stark");
     System.out.println(sb);
