		SELECT CURRENT_USER();
## To show all user
		SELECT user FROM mysql.user;
	
# GRANT

## syntax is:
		GRANT [privileges list] ON database.table TO 'uname'@'host' WITH GRANT OPTION;
- WITH GRANT OPTION is optional in syntax, specifies that this user can assign this privileges to another user of database.
- To assign all privileges to a user, use ALL keyword in place of [privileges list].
- To assign prileges on all tables, user *.* in place of database.table
## TO see privileges for a user:
		SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';
	
# REVOKE
