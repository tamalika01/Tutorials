# Anomalies in database 
- Anomalies in a database refer to inconsistencies or errors in the way data is stored or retrieved. These anomalies can arise 
	when a database is not designed properly, or when data is entered into the database incorrectly.
	- 
- There are 3 types of anomalies
## Insertion Anomalies: 
- These occur when data cannot be inserted into the database because the required fields are not complete. For example, if a 
		table requires that each record have a value for a particular field, but some records do not have that value, it will not be 
		possible to insert those records.

## Deletion Anomalies: 
- These occur when deleting data from the database unintentionally deletes other data that should have been kept. For example, 
    	if a table contains information about a customer and their orders, deleting a record of a customer may also delete all of 
    	their order records.

## Update Anomalies:
- These occur when updating data in a database results in inconsistencies. For example, if a database has 
    	duplicate records for the same customer, updating the address of one record may not update the address for all the other 
    	records.
    	
# Normalisation 
- Anomalies in database causes inaccurate information, data loss, reduced effieciency. So, it should be removed.
- Normalisation is a process to remove anomalies from database schema. It involves breaking down tables into small, more 
	manageble and anomalies free tables.
	
# Functional Dependency 
- It reprsents relationship among 2 attributes in tables.
- A->B means for a unique A, there is a unique B.
- Prime attributes are set of keys which occurs in any candidate keys.
- Non prime attributes are other keys, depends on candidate keys.

# Normal forms 
- Normal forms are set of rules which are used to design the database schema. The purpose of normal forms are to remove
	anomalies from database schema.
	
# 1NF 
- Every field of table should contain atomic value (this value shoud contain only piece of information) only.
- eg. Employee( Name (first name, last Name), email, phone), Name is violation 1NF.
- Removed data redundancy, easier to query records and remove update anomalies.
	
	
# 2NF 
- A table should be in 1NF and all of it's non-prime should depends on entire set of candidate key (no partial dependency).
- if some of columns depends only on subset of primary key, break the table into two tables, primary key of this table will
	be subset on which columns are dependent. Two tables can be related through a foreign key.
- removed data as redundancy non-prime column is dependent only on a subset of primary key which can be redundant.
- e.g Stores (customer_id, store_id, location), location only depends on store_id, while candiate key is (cust_id, store_id)
	
# 3NF 
- A table should be in 2nf and there is not transitive dependency. Every non-prime attributes directly depends on canditate key.
- so for every a->b, a should be candidate key or b should be prime attribute
- removed redundancy as non-key coumn is depending on another non-key column which can be redundant, so there are multiple
	redundant information occuring in our database.
- e.g Student( roll_no, name, city, state), roll_no->name, name->city, city->state....
	
# BCNF 
- for every functional dependency a->b a should be candidate key.
- it removes case in 3nf when there is dependency like a->b, b is prime attribute, a can not be candidate key.
	
# losless and lossy decomposition 
- During decomposition if data is not lost, it is said to losless decomposition else said to lossy decomposition.
- till 3nf losleess decomposition is guranteed.
