## 1. What is difference between DELETE VS DROP VS TRUNCATE 
1. `DELETE` is `DML` command, used to delete records from tables based on where conditions. It only delete records from a table but not structure of table.
3. `DROP` is used to drop the whole database or whole table means all records along with structure.
4. `TRUNCATE` is used to delete all record from a table, but not structure of table.
5. `DROP` and `TRUNCATE` is `DDL` command. Hence they can not be rolled back means once you droped some table or truncated all record of a table, you can not bring back, But `DELETE` is `DML` command and thus can be rolled back.
