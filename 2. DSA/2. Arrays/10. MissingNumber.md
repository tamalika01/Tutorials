# Q. Find the missing number in array.
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array1416/1?page=1&sortBy=submissions

# Approach:
- We are taking an empty map, Then we will traverse the array and check each element that it is present or not in the map, if not present 
  then store it in map. Now check from 1 to n that every number is there or not. which number is not there, it is the missing number.

# Code:
```java
HashMap<Integer,Boolean> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++)
        {
           if(!map.containsKey(array[i]))
              
               map.put(array[i], true);
        }
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
            if(!map.containsKey(i))
              return i;
        }
        return -1;


```
