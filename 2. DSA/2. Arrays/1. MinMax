Q. Find the Minimum and Maximum element.
 https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-minimum-and-maximum-element-in-an-array4428/1

Approach: From an array we have to find the minimum and maximum number. So let, min and max is the first number of array.
          now if we check that the first number is greater than the second number than we can replace it with the second number.
          Now the second number becomes min. In this way if we check upto the last of the array, when min becomes smaller than the next 
          number, then we can say that.. that is the min.
          Similarly, first number is max, check the second number with it, if second number is greater than max, then max will be 
          the second number. upto the last element of the array we have to check it, when the next number becomes smaller than the 
          max, ....then that is the max number.

Code:
 static Pair getMinMax(long a[], long n)  
    {
        long min=a[0];
        long max=a[0];
        for(int i=0; i<a.length; i++){
            if(a[i]<min)
            min=a[i];
            if(a[i]>max)
            max=a[i];
        }
        Pair minmax = new Pair(min,max);
        return minmax;
    }
