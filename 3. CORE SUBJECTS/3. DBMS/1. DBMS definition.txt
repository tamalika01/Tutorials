#### Database vs database management system ####
	- Database is a collection of inter-related data in a structured way. 
	- Depending on how we can organise data in database, There are 2 types: relational and non-relational database.
	- DBMS is a software which is used to create, manage, delete database. Many vendors provide dbms.
	
#### Advantages of dbms over file system ####
	- control data redundancy 
	- Easier to manage, provides ui
	- provides security and backup
	- provides query language
	
#### DisAdvantages ####
	- cost of hardware and software
	- difficult to manage for small project
	
#### Relational vs Non-Relational databases ####
	- Relation databases(MySql, Oracle) stores data in form of tables and columnns. Advantages are easier to maintain, provides 
	  security and query languages.
	- Non-relation database(Mongodb, radis, graphql) stores data in key-pair forms or graph databases. Suitable for large data stores.
	
#### DBMS Architechure ####
	- 1 tier architechure:
		 user directly run query to communicate directly with database.
	- 2 tier architechture:
		 application at client-side directly communicate with database server 
	- 3 tier architechture
		 client communicate with application server which communicate with database server. Client does not aware of database server
		 and database server also not aware of client server.
		

#### schema vs instance ####
	- schema means design of database. It represents how to store database.
	- instance means content of database at a particular instant of time.
	
#### 3 schema architechture ####
	- DBMS 3 tier architechture divides whole system into 3 different layer which are independent to each other.
	- View-Level
		Different users of database see different view of data.
	- Conceptual or Design-Level
		Database designer design the database architecture that how data will be organised and what are relations b/w them.
	- Physical-Level
		It describes how data is actually stored in physical disks. what are indexing used etc. Database administrator works here.
	- 3 schema architechture is used to achieve data independence.
	- data independence that change at one level does not affect the another level.
	
#### steps to design a database ####
	- Requirements gathering
	- conceptual design using E-R model
	- Logical design (Relational Model)
	- Physical level design ( deciding keys, database vendors, indexing)
