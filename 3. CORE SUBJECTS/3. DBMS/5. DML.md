1. About 
2. INSERT Query 
3. UPDATE Query 
4. DELETE Query 

## 1. About 
- Stands for Data Manipulation Language
- Provide operations to work on data inside tables.
- DML queries are not auto commited. So, changes made by these queries can be rolled back.
- 3 commands are there:
    1. `INSERT:` Used to insert record in table 
    2. `UPDATE:` Used to update record in table 
    3.  `DELETE:` Used to delete records from table.

## 2. INSERT Query 
```sql 
/* To insert record in table, providing values mapped to column names */
INSERT INTO table_name (`column_name1`, `column_name2`,...) 
VALUES (value1, value2,..);

/*
  If we are adding value to all columns then we have option to remove the column names and provide the values directly.
*/
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

/* Insert multiple rows */
INSERT INTO table_name (`column_name1`, `column_name2`,...) 
VALUES 
(value1, value2,..),
(value1, value2,..),
(value1, value2,..);
```

## 3. UPDATE Query 
```sql
/* UPDATE the record based on where condition*/
UPDATE table_name 
SET column_name1=newValue1, column_name2=newValue2
WHERE conditions;

/* can omit the where conditions, will then update each record */
UPDATE table_name 
SET column_name1=newValue1, column_name2=newValue2
WHERE conditions;
```
## 4. DELETE Query 
```sql
/* DELETE is used to records from table which passes where condition */
DELETE FROM table_name 
WHERE conditions;

/* 
    WHERE conditons are optional, we can remove then in that case will delete each record from table.
    Similar operation like truncate but remember there is a difference using truncate and delete.
    Truncate can not be rolled back while delete can be rolled back.
 */
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
