# DDL 
- Stands for data definition Language.
- Commands are used to define the structure of database.
- Commands are auto-commited, once we run these query, we can not roll back. Changes are reflected immediately
- CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE

# Show database and tables 
- login to sql client and then run to show all database created
         `SELECT NAME FROM v$database;`
- show tables of a database, first connect the database in sql developer then run 
        `SELECT owner, table_name FROM dba_tables;`

# Common data types 
1. VARCHAR(length like 20 )
        column will  have variavle character length mtbl ki agr column m length 5 aya to 5 size ka hi memory hoga pr agr VARCHAR(20)
        hai aur 25 ka length ka ek string insert hoga to ye first 20 hi insert krega..matlab small hoga to utna size bada hoga to no allow

2. INTEGER

# constraints 
- constraints are conditions which are applied to a column and every record must follow that constraints.
- some commonn constraints:
    1. NOT NULL:
            you can leave this column filed blank or insert null value.
    2. PRIMARY KEY: 
            This column must contains unique value for each record.
    3. FOREIGN KEY:
            This column must contain the value of primary key of another column in another table.

            

    #### CREATE 
	- This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers).
    - Steps to create database:
        1. login to sql command line 
            CONNECT username/password.
        2. run the command to create database
	        CREATE DATABASE my_database; 
	- CREATE TABLE table_name(
		column1 data_type [other constraints] PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT=1,
		column2 data_type [other constraints] NOT NULL DEFAULT="some default value",
		....,
		columnn data_type [other constraints],
		PRIMARY KEY (column1, column2),
		FOREIGN KEY (column4) REFERENCES table_another(column),
		UNIQUE (column5),
		
	  );
	- CREATE TABLE table_name AS
		< write a select query from an existing table >


    #### DROP ####
	- Used to drop database, tables,indexes, views.
	- droping a table means to delete all records as well as schema of database or table
	- DROP DATABASE database_name;
	- DROP TABLE table_name;
	

    #### TRUNCATE ####
	- used to delete all record from a table but maintains the schema of table.
	- TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

    #### ALTER ####
	- Used to modify existing schema includes adding new column, constraints or deleting existing column or constraints or updating
	existing columns or constrains.
	- ALTER TABLE table_name
		a. ADD column_name [other constraints]
		b. ADD UNIQUE(column_name) or PRIMARY KEY (column)
		c. DROP  COLUMN column_name;
		d. RENAME column_name TO new_name;
		e. RENAME TO new_table_name
		f. ALTER column_name data_type [other constraints]
