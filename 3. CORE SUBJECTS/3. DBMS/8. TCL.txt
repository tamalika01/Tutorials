#### TCL ####
	- Stands for transaction control language
	- Used to manage transactions in sql
	- Commands are COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT
	
#### Transactions ####
	- Transaction in a database is a sequence of operations that are executed as a single logical unit of work. These operations
	can include INSERT or UPDATE or DELETE or READ data from database.
	- To ensure transactions are executed as reliable and consistently, every transaction follows ACID property.

#### ACID Properties ####
	- A : Atomicity
		Every operation of transaction should be executed succesfully or none of operations should execute at all.
	- C : Consistency
		A transaction must leave database in consistent state after it's execution meaning that database must maintain all data 
		integrity rules and constraints.
	- I : Isolation
		 Multiple transactions executing parallely are isolated from each other to avoid conflicts. It ensures that each transaction
		 operates on a separate view of data.
	- D: Durability
		Once a transaction has been committed, its changes must be durable and persistent, meaning that they are permanently stored in 
		the database and cannot be lost.
		
#### COMMANDS ####
	- COMMIT;
		mark the changes made by a transaction to database permanently;
	- ROLLBACK; or ROLLBACK TO <save point name>;
		roll back changes to last commited state or a save point;
	- SAVEPOINT save_point_name;
		create a save point here.
		
#### Transaction states ####
	- Active state:
		Transactions are executing it's Read and write operation in this state
	- Partially Commited:
		All the read/write operation is complete but commit operation is remaining
	- Commited:
		Transaction is commited and changes are made permanently to the database.
	- Failed state:
		if during active state or partially commited state, any failure occurs and system unable to proceed further reached into this
		state.
	- Aborted state:
		if transaction goes into failed state, roll back operation is executed and it moved to aborted state.
	- Terminated state:
		from commited state or aborted state, it reached to terminated state means transaction ended.
		
		
#### Advantages ####
	    - Data consistency: 
	    	Transactions ensure that the database is consistent, even when multiple users access the same data concurrently. 
	    	Transactions enforce data integrity by grouping related operations into a single unit of work, so either all the 
	    	operations succeed or none of them do. This prevents data inconsistencies and corruption.

    	- Concurrent access: 
    		Transactions enable multiple users to access the same data concurrently without interfering with each other's work. 
    		Transactions use locking mechanisms to ensure that only one user can modify a particular piece of data at a time, 
    		preventing conflicts.

    	- Rollback: 
    		Transactions can be rolled back if an error occurs during execution. The database is returned to its previous state, and 
    		no partial updates are committed. This ensures that data integrity is maintained and that incomplete or erroneous data is 
    		not left in the database.

    	- Performance: 
    		Transactions improve the performance of the database by grouping multiple operations into a single transaction. This 
    		reduces the overhead of managing individual operations and improves throughput.

    	- Data durability: 
    		Transactions ensure that data changes are permanently stored in the database, even if the system crashes or experiences a 
    		power failure. Once a transaction is committed, its changes are durable and cannot be lost.


#### DisAdvantages ####
	- Overhead: 
		Transactions can add overhead to the database system, particularly when dealing with large volumes of data. This overhead 
		can slow down the system and impact performance.
	- Deadlocks: 
		Transactions can lead to deadlocks, where two or more transactions are waiting for resources that are being held by each 
		other. This can cause the system to hang, requiring manual intervention to resolve.
	- Locking: 
		Transactions use locking mechanisms to prevent conflicts when multiple users access the same data concurrently. However, 
		locking can also lead to contention for resources and impact system performance.
	- Durability: 
		Transactions ensure that data changes are durable and permanent, but this can also lead to issues if incorrect data is 
		committed. Recovering from such situations can require significant effort and potentially impact system availability.
