#### DQL ####
	- Stands for Data Query Language
	- Used to fetch data from tables using conditions.
	- eg. SELECT command
	
#### SELECT ####
	- Used to fetch record from table or tables
	- syntax:
		SELECT col1, col2, ...,coln
	  	FROM table1, table2, table3
	  	WHERE conditions;
	- SELECT * is used to show all columns in table
	- SELECT DISTINCT is used to remove duplicate data from result set
		SELECT DISTINCT col1, coln
		FROM tables
		WHERE conditions;

#### WHERE Clause ####
	- WHERE col=val AND col!=val OR col>=val;
	- all arithmetic operators are supported with logical grouping as well(AND, OR, NOT)
	- Some additonal operators are also supported:
		BETWEEN: true if value if coumn is in range inclusive to both
			WHERE col BETWEEN val1 and val2;
		LIKE: return true if column matches with provided pattern
			WHERE col like pattern;
			WHERE col like 'a%b_'; 
			% matches any no. of character any no. of time
			[] matches one character in this list
			[a-z] matches one character in this range
			_ matches any character one time
		IN: return true if col values is present in given result set
			WHERE col in (val1, val2, val3);
			WHERE col in (select query);
		EXISTS: return true if a result-set contain atleast one record
			WHERE EXISTS (select query);
		ANY: return true if col matches with any value in given result set;
			WHERE col = ANY (select query or val1, val2, val3)
		ALL: return true if col matches condition with all value in given result set.
			WHERE col = ALL (select query or val1, val2,val3)

#### ORDER BY ####
	- used to sort the result set
	- syntax:
		SELECT *
		FROM table
		WHERE condition
		ORDER BY col1, col2,..,coln ASC | DESC;
	- Sort the result in ascending order by default, to sort in descending order use DESC;

#### ROWNUM ####
	- used to restrict the no. of record
	- syntax:
		SELECT *
        FROM (SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name(s))
        WHERE ROWNUM <= number;

#### SQL functions to use in select####
	- COUNT
		count total records or total non nullable record for a particular column
		returns a single value
		SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
	- MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM
		returns mathematical single value from a numeric column
		SELECT MIN(col1), MAX(col2), AVG(col3), SUM(col4) FROM table_name;
    - ROWNUM() OVER ( PARTITION BY col1, col2,... coln ORDER BY col1, col2,...coln ASC | DESC ) AS rank_num
		return the row numbers of each column

#### Set Operations ####
	- Used to perform on 2 select query
	- both select query should return equal no. of columns and of same data type
	- return result in ascending order.
	- UNION
		SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 UNION SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
	- UNION ALL
		(select query1) UNION ALL (select query2);
		duplicates are also present, like concat the 2 result set.
	- INTERSECTION
		SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name(s) WHERE condition INTERSECT SELECT column_name(S) FROM table_name(S)
        return common records of 2 sets.
	- MINUS
		SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition MINUS SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
        return records which are present in result set1 but not in result set2

#### JOINS ####
	- JOINs in sql are used to fetch record from 2 or more tables.
	- syntax:
		select t1.col1, t2.col2
		FROM table1 <join_type> tabl2 <join condition>
		where conditions;
	- Join type:
		INNER JOIN or JOIN
			It returns rows from 2 or more tables which passes the join conditions.
			SYNTAX: SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
			SELECT COMPANY.NAME, EMPLOYEE_1.NAME, EMPLOYEE_1.EMP_ID FROM COMPANY 
			INNER JOIN EMPLOYEE_1 ON COMPANY.COMPANY_ID=EMPLOYEE_1.COMPANY_ID;

		LEFT JOIN
			A left join returns all the rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match in 
			the right table, the result will contain NULL values for the right table's columns.
			SYNTAX: SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

		RIGHT JOIN
			A right join returns all the rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If there is no match in 
			the right table, the result will contain NULL values for the left table's columns.
			SYNTAX:SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

		FULL JOIN
			A full join returns all the rows from the both table which passes the join conditions. Also it includes all record
			from left table which does not match with any record in right table on join condition. For all the records of this
			type, populates null value for right table columns. Similiearly, includes all record from right table which does
			not matches with any records from left table and populate null values on left table columns for this kind of record.
			SYNTAX: SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name WHERE condition;

		CROSS JOIN
			returns cartesian product of 2 tables
			SELECT * FROM [Table_1] CROSS JOIN [Table_2]


	- Join Conditions:
		- ON <where clause predicates>
			cartesian product the 2 tables and apply this predicate to select if matches or not
			applies on every kind of join type
		- USING (column1, column2,..)
			if both tables have same name and data type of column, it will apply equal predicates on both tables.
		- NATURAL join
			- it is a join operation which implicitly create a join condition that common columns in both table should have equal 
			values.
			- It applies on inner join, left join, right join //yha tk bolna natural join k puche t 
			- It returns result field in order, <common columns> then <left table remaining columns> then <rigt table remaining columns>
			- e.g table1 natural join tabl2 or table1 natural left join tabl2;
