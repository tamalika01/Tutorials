# Keys and data-model in database 

## 1. Primary Key:
1. It is used to uniquely identifies 2 records in the table.
2. It enforce 2 conditions on primary key columns:
	1. Primary key column must be unique for each record.
	2. It must not be null.

## 2.Foreign Key:
1. A foreign key in a relational database management system (DBMS) is a field or a set of fields in a table that refers to the primary key of another table.
2. It is used to establish relationship among two tables.
3. primary key can also act as a foreign key.
4. table which have foreign key is called as referencing table and table which it refers is called as referenced table.

## 3. What is Referential Integrity 
1. Referntial integrity are set of rules that maintain the data consitency and integrity between related tables:
2. Below are Referntial integrity constrains which can be used when creating a foreign key:
	1. RESTRICT: prevents the deletion or update of a row in the referenced table if there are corresponding rows in the referencing table.
	2. CASCADE: when a row in the referenced table is deleted or updated, the corresponding rows in the referencing table are also deleted or updated automatically.
	3. SET NULL: when a row in the referenced table is deleted or updated, the corresponding foreign key values in the referencing table are set to NULL.
	4. SET DEFAULT: when a row in the referenced table is deleted or updated, the corresponding foreign key values in the referencing table are set to a default value.

## 3. Data Model 
- Defines the design how data is organised in database.
- types:
    - a. E-R model
	- b. Relational Data Model
	- c. Object Based data Model
	- d. Semi structured data Model
		

## 4. E-R data Model 
- stands for Entity relationship model
- it is used for conceptual design of database.
- objects are reprsented as entity and relationship among objects are portyaed using diagrams.
- components:
	- Entity: represents an object using rectancle figure
	- attribute: represents property of object using eclipse figure
	- relationship: diamond shape is used to represent relationship among 2 entities:
		- it can be 1:1, 1:many, many:1, many:many
	- Primary attribute: uniquely identifies 2 records, attribute is underlined.
			
			
# Relational Data Model 
- It stores data in form of tables, each table consists of columns and rows. columns represents attributes while rows represents
	records. 
- Called relational because table can relate to each other using concept of foreign key.
