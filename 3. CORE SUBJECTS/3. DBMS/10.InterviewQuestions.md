## 1. What is difference between DELETE VS DROP VS TRUNCATE 
1. DELETE is DML command, used to delete records from tables based on where conditions. It only delete records from a table but not structure of table.
2. DROP and TRUNCATE is DDL command.
3. DROP is used to drop the whole database or whole table means all records along with structure.
4. TRUNCATE is used to delete all record from a table, but not structure of table.
5. DROP and TRUNCATE can not be rolled back while DELETE can be rolled back.

## 2. PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY
- A PRIMARY KEY is a unique identifier for a record in a database table. It must contain unique values and cannot be null.
- A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that is used to link two tables together. The FOREIGN KEY in one table points to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

## 3. What are joins and its types
- Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column. The different types of joins are:
1. **INNER JOIN:** Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
2. **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN:** Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
3. **RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN:** Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
4. **FULL (OUTER) JOIN:** Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

## 4. What is a transaction
- A transaction is a single unit of work. 
- If a transaction is successful, all of the data modifications made during the transaction are committed and become a permanent part of the database. 
- If a transaction encounters errors and must be cancelled or rolled back, then all of the data modifications are erased.

## 5. What is Normalisation and some normal forms
- Normalisation is a database design technique which organizes tables in a manner that reduces redundancy and dependency of data. Some normal forms are:
1. **First Normal Form (1NF):** Each table cell should contain a single value and duplicate rows are not permitted.
2. **Second Normal Form (2NF):** It is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
3. **Third Normal Form (3NF):** It is in 2NF and no non-key attribute is dependent on any other non-key attribute.

## 6. Explain ACID Properties
- ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. These are properties of a database transaction.
1. **Atomicity:**  Every operation of transaction should be executed succesfully or none of operations should execute at all.
2. **Consistency:** A transaction must leave database in consistent state after it's execution meaning that database must maintain all data integrity rules and constraints.
3. **Isolation:** Multiple transactions executing parallely are isolated from each other to avoid conflicts. It ensures that each transaction operates on a separate view of data.
4. **Durability:** Once a transaction has been committed, its changes must be durable and persistent, meaning that they are permanently stored in the database and cannot be lost.
