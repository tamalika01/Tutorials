# Indexer
- An indexer is a special type of property that allows a class or a structure to be accessed like an array for its internal collection.
- When you define an indexer for a class, this class behaves similar to a virtual array or a collection type. 
- You can then access the instance of this class using the array axis operator that is a square bracket {[]}.
- ```java
     element type this [int index]{
        get{}
        set{}
     }
  ```

# Enum
-  an enum is a user-defined datatype that has a fixed set of related values.
- We create a enum keyword to create a enum.
- ```java
   enum Properties{
    May,
    June, 
    July
   }
  ```

# Delegates 
- a delegate is nothing but a pointer to a method.
- delegate is a reference to the method.
- it is object-oriented, secured, and type-safe rather than only function pointer.
- A delegate holds the address of a method which can be called using the delegate reference variable.
-  For static method, delegate encapsulates method only but for instance method, it encapsulates method instance both.
- There are three steps involved while working with delegate, declaring a delegate, set a target method or a method to which we need to refer, and third is to invoke the delegate.
