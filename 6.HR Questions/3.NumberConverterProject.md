# 1. Tell me about the project.
1. This project is a web-based number converter. 
2. It allows users to convert numbers from one format to another like from binary format to decimal or  form octal to binary etc.
3. The purpose of the project was to provide a easy to use tool to user who wants to convert numbers from one format into another for their need.
4. It suppots binary, decimal, hexadecimal, and octal conversions.
6. Tech Stack uses is HTML, CSS and javascript.

# 2. How is the conversion between different number formats handled in the code?
1. Conversion is performed using javascript builtin parseInt method and toString methods to convert between different number bases.

# 3. How you are handling invalid inputs and displaying error messages.
1. The project uses a combination of HTML form validation and JavaScript validation to handle user input.
2. As soon an user click the submit form to convert the numbers, I am validating all data using a javascript function. 
3. This function checks various constraints like input are not emptys, from and to field are valid and not same etc. If any constrain is failed, I am displaying the error message using javascript dom api.

# 4. What are challenges faced 
1. As this is my first web based project, I faced difficulties for the screen preview in various screens. Later I learned about
media quieries and solved that.
2. I also faced some difficulties in javascript functions and dom.


# 5. What are some future improvements can be made.
1. Adding support for more number formats.
2. Improving the user interface with a modern UI library or framework.
3. Adding unit tests to ensure the conversion functions work correctly.
4. Implementing a history feature that keeps track of the user's past conversions.

# 6. What is complete flow of project.
