# Fonts and Display 
- The Css display property is used to determine whether an element is treated as a block/inline 
   element and the layout used for its children.

 ##  display : inline
-  Takes only the space required by the element. No linebreaks before and after.
-   Setting width/height is not allowed.

##  display : block
- Takes full space available in width and leaves a newline before and after the element.

## display : inline-block 
- Similar to inline but setting width,height,margin, padding is allowed. 
-  Elements can sit next to each other.

## display : none and visibility : hidden 
-  display:none, the element is removed from the document flow but space is not blocked.
- visibility:hidden, the element is hidden but its space is reserved.

## text-align property 
- used to set the horizontal alignment of a text.

## text-decoration property 
- used to decorate the text can be overline, line through, underline and none.

## text-transform property 
-  used to specify uppercase and lowercase letters in a text.

     line-height:0.7;
