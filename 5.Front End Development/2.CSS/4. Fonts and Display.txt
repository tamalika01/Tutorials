-- The Css display property is used to determine whether an element is treated as a block/inline 
   element and the layout used for its children.

         Takes only the space required by the element. No linebreaks before and after.
         Setting width/height is not allowed.

2. display : block--
          Takes full space available in width and leaves a newline before and after the element.

3. display : inline-block --
           Similar to inline but setting width,height,margin, padding is allowed. 
           Elements can sit next to each other.

4. display : none and visibility : hidden --
            display:none, the element is removed from the document flow but space is not blocked.
            visibility:hidden, the element is hidden but its space is reserved.
