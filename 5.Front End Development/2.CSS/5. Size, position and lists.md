   -  vw-- unit related to 1% viewport width
   -  vh-- unit relative to 1% viewport height
   -  %-- unit relative to parent element

## Position property:
- static-- default position. top/bottom/left/right/z-index has no effect
-  relative-- top/bottom/left/right/z-index will now work.
- absolute-- element is removed from the flow and is relatively positioned to its first non static anchestor.
-  fixed-- just like absolute except the element is positioned relative to the browser window.
-  sticky-- element is positioned based on user's scroll position.

## list style property:
- it is a shorthand for type, position and image
- `ul{
   list-style: square inside url('harry.png');
   }`        

## z- index property:
- it specifies the stack order of an element.
- it defines which layer will be above in case of overlapping elements.
