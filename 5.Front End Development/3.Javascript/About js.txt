### JAVASCRIPT ###

1. Js is written in <script> tag.
2. A js function is a block of code, that can be executed when called for.
3. A function can be called when a event occurs, like when we click a button.
4. A js function can be placed in both head section or body section.
5. we can create a file with .js extension and link it to html page.
    like myScript.js is the file name
       in html page will be <script src = "myscript.js" ></sricpt>

       // output //
6. JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
      --Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
      --Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
      --Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
      --Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

7. Using innerHTML:
    To acess the html element, js can use the document.getElementsById(id) method.
    <p id="sum"> The sum is: </p>
    <script>
        document.getElementsById("sum").innerHTML = 5+6;
    </script> 
8. For testing purposes, it is convinent to use document.write() method.
    document.write(5+6); // in script tag, not required id
9. window is global object, we can also skip it.
    window.alert(5+6); or alert(5+6);  // in script tag
10. For debugging, we can use console.log  
     console.log(5+6); // in script tag

     // Statements //
11. Js statements consists of values, expression, operators, keywords and comments.
      document.getElementsById("name").innerHTML = "hello tamalika";

12. Variables:
       let a, b,c;
       a=3; b=4; c=5; //can be assigned values in same line by using semicolon

       -- var: declare a Variable   // can be redeclared
       -- let: declare a block Variable // cannot redeclared
       -- const: declare a block constant // cannot redeclared

13. js syntax defines two types of values.
             -- fixed values are called literals.
             -- variable values are called variables.

14. js uses arithmetic operators to compute values.
             -- they are +, -, /, *

15. js uses assignment operators to assign values to variables.
            -- it is =

16 js type operators:
            -- typeof: returns the type of a variable
            -- instanceof: returns true if an object is an instance of object type.

17. JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
            1. String    2. Number    3. Bigint     4. Boolean
            5. Undefined       6. Null      7. Symbol     8. Object

18. The Object Datatype
          The object data type can contain
          1. An object    2. An array     3. A date

19. Javascript numbers are always one type: double (64-bit floating point).

20. javaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.
    Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
    const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
    // accessing objects
    objectname.propertyname; like car.color; 

21. A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
    A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
    A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
      function name(parameter1, parameter2,...){
        //write the code here
      }
      
22.  What is this?
          --In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.
          --Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).
          --The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:
          -- this.color means color is the property of the object.

23. // accesing object methods
         objectname.methodName();
         eg: person.walks();

24. // events
   Here are some examples of HTML events:
         --An HTML web page has finished loading
         --An HTML input field was changed
         --An HTML button was clicked

25. // onclick
    <element event = some javaScript>
    eg: <button onlick = document.getElementsById("demo").innerHTML = Date()> The date is? </button>

    or  <button onclick=displayDate()>The date is?</button>
          -- here displayDate is the function
