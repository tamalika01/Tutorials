## 1. Object Literal
1. Creating object:
	```javascript
	let obj = { 
		prop1 : 10,
		prop2 : "name",
		prop3 : ["item1", "item2"],
		prop4: function() { // code block for this function 
						  },
		prop5() {//code block for this function 
				}
	};	
	```
2. Accessing the variable
	```javascript
	// Read data propery 
	let a = obj.prop1;
	// or another [] notation syntax
	let b = obj['prop1']
	// Using [] bracket notation, we can use any js expression to get the property at run time
	
	// Executin the function 
	obj.prop4();
	obj.prop5();

	// Setting or updating the properties
	obj.prop6 = value; or obj['prop6'] = value;
	```
		
## 2. Object prototype 
- Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. 
- The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.
- Default prototype of an object is Object.
- to access prototype: `object.__proto__`
- Accessing any property on object first search the property in object, then it's prototype obj, then it's prototype'prototype and so on untill the end of prototype chain.
- Setting the prototype for an object:
	```javascript
	// 1st way: Create object whose proto will be an existing js object.
	const obj = Object.create(exisitingObjectAsProto);

	// 2nd way: Change the function's prototype property and use this function as constructor.
	// Every function in js has a prototype property (funcName.prototype) which is an object and has one field constructor, which
	//contain the code of function itself.
	// Default code:
	funcName.prototype = {
		constructor:function funcName() {}
	}

	// When we use the new keyword to create the object from a constructor, it assign the prototype property of function to 
	// prototype of object.
	// We can change constructor default prototype using
	Object.assign(funcName.prototype, protypeObject);

	```
		
## 3. Classical OOPs Concept
1. Defining class:
	```javascript
	class className{
		a;
		b="default value";
		#c;		// c is a private variable and only be accessible inside this class
		
		constructor(arga, argb){
			this.a = arga;
			this.b = argb;
		}
	
		method1() {}
		
		method2() {}
		
		#method3() {}	// This is a private method
	}
	
	```
2. Inheritance:
	```javascript
	class a extends b {}
	```
		
3. Comparing Object:
	- First Object's valueOf method is called, if valueOf is not defined then toString() is called and then comparison happens.
