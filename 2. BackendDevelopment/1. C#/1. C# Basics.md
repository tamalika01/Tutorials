# C#

## Fetures:
- These are the major features of C#. 
- It is simple, fast as per their performance beat. 
- Object oriented, type safe. type support variables and their declarations are available.
-  Interoperability, scalable, rich library, as well as it supports modern aspects of programming language.

## Output
- `Console.WriteLine("Hello World");`
 - It will write the output and comes the cursor to next line...but we cannot read it.
- `Console.ReadLine();`
 - Now we can see and read the Hello World.
- `Console.Write("Hi");`
 - It will print Hi and cursor remains in the same line.

## Comments
- Use // to write  single line comments.
 - `// Important tips`
- Use /* ...*/ for multiple line comments.
 - `/* something about c#*/`

## Variables
- int, float, char(Character), double, bool(boolean), String
- We have to write `float a = 3.4F;` same as `Double b = 3.7D;`
 - We are writing like that beacause if we dont write F or D then there will be compile error directly.

## Data Type
- C# has a unified type system. This unified type system is called Common Type System (CTS).

- A unified type system implies that all types, including primitives such as integers, are subclasses of the System.Object class. For example, every type inherits a ToString() method.

- CTS separates data types into two categories:
   - Reference types
   - Value types

## Trick: For comment out select the line then ctrl+k+c

## Type Casting:
- There are two types typecasting.
  - 1. Implicit - compiler do by own
  - 2. Explicit - we have to do it. ex: `int a = (int) 8.5; // result will be 8`
  - There are some build-in methods also. like Convert.ToString();.....etc

## Taking User Input
- ```java
  Console.WriteLine("Enter your name"); // Write the string
  var name = Console.ReadLine(); // store the input in name var
  Console.WriteLine("Hey Hello " + name); // concat the name var 
  Console.ReadLine(); // Read the previous line
  ```

## Operators
- 1. Arithmetic Operators
     - +, -, *, /
- 2. Assignment Operators
     - =, <=, >=, 
- 3. Logical Operators
     - && , ||
- 4. Comparison Operators
     - ==

## Math Class
- ```java
   int a = Math.Max(12, 15);
   Console.WriteLine(a);
  ``` 
- same as Min(a,b) returns the minimum number.
- Sqrt(a) returns the square root.

## Size
- a.Length // note that L should be capital

## UpperCase & LowerCase
- a.ToUpper() : whole string becomes in uppercase
- a.ToLower() : whole tring becomes in lowercse

## String Concat
- 

## If-Else
- ```java
   int age = 18;
   if (age > 21)
   {
      Console.WriteLine("You are ready to marry.");
   }
   else if(age == 18)
   {
      Console.WriteLine("you are just an adult");
   }
   else
   {
      Console.WriteLine("You are not ready for marry.");
   }
     Console.ReadLine();
  ```

## Switch case:
- ```java
   int roll = 5;
   switch (roll)
   {
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine("You are the first girl in your class.");
        break;
    case 2:
        Console.WriteLine("You are the second.");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Enjoy!");
        break;
  }
   Console.ReadLine();
  ```

## Loops

### while loops
- ```java
   int i=0;
        while(i<5){
            Console.WriteLine (i);
            i++;
        }
        Console.ReadLine();
  ```
### do-while loop
- ```java
  int i=0;
        do{
            Console.WriteLine (i);
            i++;
        }while(i<5);
        Console.ReadLine();
  ```
### for loops
- ```java
  for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
            Console.WriteLine (i);
        }
        Console.ReadLine();
   ```

## Arrays:

## Something about .Net
- .Net is a framework, meaning that it is a complete tool by which one can create, run, debug a c# project.
- It provides all the things, like
   - 1. Compiler(it creates a .exe fie in bin folder)
   - 2. Library(many inbuilt function like WriteLine(), ReadLine() are here, where the .Net sdk provides the library to us.)
   - 3. Run time engine(At last the .exe file made in the bin folder, compiler runs it in our laptop by the run time environment)

- Now .Net is a software so to communicate with it there are some commands.
- By using .Net we can create many types of project
   - 1. Console Project(Taking input from console and taking output from console)
   - 2. Web App(Website)

## Top Level statements
- Top-level statements in C# are a feature that allows developers to write code directly at the root of a file, without having to wrap it in a class or a method. The main method is the entry point of the program, but with Top-level Statement, we donâ€™t have the main method. We can have only one Top-level Statement in class.

## What is Synchronous and Asynchronous?
- Synchronous sometimes referred to as sync and asynchronous, also known as async and these are two types of programming models.
-  Synchronous is known as a blocking architecture and is idle for programming reactive system. 
-program wait for method to complete before continuing to execute the next line of code. That is what it is also known as blocking architecture.

- Asynchronous programming is a multithreaded model that's most applicable to networking and communication. And this is also known as a non blocking architecture, which means it does not block further execution while one or more operations are in progress.

# How C# code runs?
- When you execute a C# program on a computer, the process involves several steps:

 ## 1. Compilation:
- You write your C# code using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio.
The C# compiler translates your source code into an intermediate language known as Common Intermediate Language (CIL) or Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL).
The compiler generates an assembly file (with a .dll or .exe extension) containing the compiled code.
## 2. Intermediate Language (IL) and Assembly:
- The assembly file contains the compiled CIL code, which is platform-independent.
The assembly file can be distributed and executed on any system that has a compatible Common Language Runtime (CLR).
## 3. Common Language Runtime (CLR):
- The CLR is a part of the .NET Framework or .NET Core runtime environment, depending on the version of .NET you are using.
When you run your C# program, the CLR takes over the execution process.
## 4. Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:
- The CLR's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler translates the CIL code into native machine code specific to the computer's architecture.
This compilation process occurs at runtime, just before the program is executed.
## 5. Execution:
- The native machine code is executed by the computer's hardware.
The program follows the logic and instructions you've written in your C# code, performing the specified operations.
## 6. Memory Management:
- The CLR handles memory management, including memory allocation and deallocation.
Garbage Collection is a part of this process, automatically reclaiming memory that is no longer in use to prevent memory leaks.
## 7. Exception Handling:
- C# provides robust support for exception handling.
If an error or exceptional condition occurs during program execution, your code can include exception-handling mechanisms to gracefully manage and recover from these situations.
