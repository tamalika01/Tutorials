# Session:
- session is a state that is used to store and retrieve values of a user.
- It helps to identify requests from the same browser during a time period (session). It is used to store value for the particular time session. By default, ASP.NET session state is enabled for all ASP.NET applications.

# Cookie:
- ASP.NET Cookie is a small bit of text that is used to store user-specific information. This information can be read by the web application whenever user visits the site.
- When a user requests for a web page, web server sends not just a page, but also a cookie containing the date and time. This cookie stores in a folder on the user's hard disk.
- There are two ways to store cookies in ASP.NET application.
     - Cookies collection
     - HttpCookie

# JWT Authentication
