# SOLID Principles

## The SOLID principles are five essential guidelines that enhance software design, making code more maintainable and scalable.  These five principles are:

-  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
-  Open/Closed Principle
-  Liskov’s Substitution Principle (LSP)
-  Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
-  Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

#### The SOLID principle helps in reducing tight coupling. Tight coupling means a group of classes are highly dependent on one another which you should avoid in your code.

#### Opposite of tight coupling is loose coupling and your code is considered as a good code when it has loosely-coupled classes.Loosely coupled classes minimize changes in your code, helps in making code more reusable, maintainable, flexible and stable.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
- This principle states that `A class should have only one reason to change` which means every class should have a single responsibility or single job or single purpose. In other words, a class should have only one job or purpose within the software system.

- Example: Imagine a baker who is responsible for baking bread. The baker’s role is to focus on the task of baking bread, ensuring that the bread is of high quality, properly baked, and meets the bakery’s standards.

## Open/Closed Principle:
- This principle states that `Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification` which means you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.

- Example: Imagine you have a class called PaymentProcessor that processes payments for an online store. Initially, the PaymentProcessor class only supports processing payments using credit cards. However, you want to extend its functionality to also support processing payments using PayPal.

- Instead of modifying the existing PaymentProcessor class to add PayPal support, you can create a new class called PayPalPaymentProcessor that extends the PaymentProcessor class. This way, the PaymentProcessor class remains closed for modification but open for extension, adhering to the Open-Closed Principle.

## Liskov’s Substitution Principle (LSP):
- According to this principle `Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes`. This principle ensures that any class that is the child of a parent class should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behavior.

- Example: One of the classic examples of this principle is a rectangle having four sides. A rectangle’s height can be any value and width can be any value. A square is a rectangle with equal width and height. So we can say that we can extend the properties of the rectangle class into square class. 

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
- It states that `do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them`.

- Example: Suppose if you enter a restaurant and you are pure vegetarian. The waiter in that restaurant gave you the menu card which includes vegetarian items, non-vegetarian items, drinks, and sweets. 

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
- The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is a principle in object-oriented design that states that `High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions`. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

- Example: In a software development team, developers depend on an abstract version control system (e.g., Git) to manage and track changes to the codebase. They don’t depend on specific details of how Git works internally. 


# Need for SOLID Principles:
- SOLID principles make code easier to maintain. When each class has a clear responsibility, it’s simpler to find where to make changes without affecting unrelated parts of the code.

- These principles support growth in software. For example, the Open/Closed Principle allows developers to add new features without changing existing code, making it easier to adapt to new requirements.

- SOLID encourages flexibility. By depending on abstractions rather than specific implementations (as in the Dependency Inversion Principle), developers can change components without disrupting the entire system.
