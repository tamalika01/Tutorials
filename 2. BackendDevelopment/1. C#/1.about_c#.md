## 1. About/Features of C#
- C# is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It provides various features that make development efficient and robust.
- Some of Key Features it provides are:
    1. `Object-Oriented:` Supports oops features abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
    2. `Cross-Platform Portability:` Can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS using .NET Core.
    3. `Automatic Memory Management:` Memory is automatically cleaned by garbage collectors.
    4. `Type-Safe:` Prevents type errors during compilation, ensuring safer code execution.

## 2. Core Components of C#
- C# consists of multiple components that work together to create applications.
- Important Components:
    1. `.NET Framework / .NET Core:` Provides the runtime and libraries for C# applications.
    2. `Common Language Runtime (CLR):` The execution environment that manages memory, security, and garbage collection.
    3. `Base Class Library (BCL):` A collection of predefined classes and methods for file handling, networking, and more.
    4. `C# Compiler (csc.exe):` Converts C# code into Intermediate Language (IL).
    5. `Assemblies:` Compiled code packaged into .dll (Dynamic Link Library) or .exe (Executable) files.
    6. `Namespaces:` Organizes classes and prevents naming conflicts (e.g., System, System.IO).

## 3. How C# Code Runs
1. `Writing Code:` Developers write C# code in a .cs file.
2. `Compilation:` The C# compiler (csc.exe) converts code into Intermediate Language (IL).
3. `Metadata and Assemblies:` The compiled IL is stored in .exe or .dll files.
4. `Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:` When executed, the CLR compiles IL into machine code specific to the operating system.
5. `Execution:` The program runs within the managed environment of the CLR.

## 4. Garbage Collection in C#
- Garbage Collection (GC) is an automatic memory management feature in C# that frees up heap memory occupied by unused objects.
- Memory is not un-limited, and we need to clean it in order to make room for new objects else our application will crash as we will not be able to create new objects.
How Garbage Collection Works:
- .NET runtime runs the Garbage collection process periodically.  Garbage collection scans the heap memory to identify objects that are no longer reachable (i.e., not referenced by any active part of the program) and removed unreachable objects.
- Note: The `GC.Collect()` method can be used to mannualy call garbage collection, but it's not recommended unless necessary.

## 5. Memory Structure in C#
- Memory in C# is divided into different sections to optimize performance and organization.
- Memory Layout:
    1. `Stack:` It Stores all primitives or reference variables created in a function. when function completes, all data is removed from stack.
    2. `Heap:` It stores all the objects created. Reference variables are stored in stack but actual Objects live in the heap. Removed from heap by garbage collectors.
    3. `Code Segment:` Stores compiled code and method instructions.
    4. `Static Memory:` Stores static variables and constants.
