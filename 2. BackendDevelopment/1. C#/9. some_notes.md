# LINQ:
- - LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) is a feature in C# that allows you to query collections, databases,
 XML, and other data sources in a more readable and concise way using a syntax similar to SQL.

 # Middleware:
 - Middleware is software that sits between the client and server in an application and processes requests and responses.
  In ASP.NET Core, middleware components are used to handle requests, process them, and pass them down the pipeline.

  # MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER:
  - 1. `Model (Data & Business Logic)`:
        - Represents the data and business logic of the application.
        - Retrieves and processes data from the database.
        - Validates user input before storing it.

 - 2. `View (User Interface)`:
        - Responsible for displaying the data.
        - Uses Razor syntax (@) in ASP.NET MVC.
        - Should contain minimal logic (only for display purposes)

 - 3. `Controller (Handles Requests & Logic)`:
        - Manages the interaction between Model and View.
        - Receives HTTP requests, processes them, and returns the response.
        - Calls the Model to fetch data and passes it to the View

 # How MVC Works Together
   - User requests a page (/Patient/Index).
   - Controller (PatientController) processes the request and calls the Model to get data.
   - Model fetches data from the database.
   - Controller sends the data to the View.
   - View renders the data and returns the response to the user.

 # Dependency Injection:
 -  DI design pattern is a technique that reduces the connection between system components, making the code more modular,
 testable, and maintainable.
