# HTTP:
- HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of the World Wide Web, defining the rules for how information is transferred between web browsers and servers, enabling the exchange of web pages and other data. 

# HTTPS:
- HTTPS, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol used to transfer data across the internet, ensuring encrypted communication between a web browser and a website.

## example
- resturant table ----request/order---> chef -----waitor/server----response/cooked food--->back to table

## How http works?
- verb(action to take)
- headers(information)
- content(optional)
- ex: verb: POST,
content length: 9,
content: Magic API

- Response - {status code, headers, content} - {201, Text, Magic Api}

## stateless
- server is a stateless meaning that it will not remember things. because server gets multiple requests, once it serves the request/response then, it forgets about the request/response. Because memory consumption will haven, thus disk will be overloaded. 

# Request Object:

## Verb(HTTPS verbs or actions)
- GET: fetches/requests resource
- POST: creates/inserts resource
- PUT: update/modify resource
- PATCH: update/modify partial resource
- DELETE: deletes/ removes resource

## Headers(Request's metadata)
- Content Type: content's format
- Content Length: size of content
- Authorization: who is making request
- Accept: what are the accepted types

## Content(Request's content)optional
- HTML, CSS, XML, JSON
- Information for the request
- Blobs etc.

# Response Object:

## Status Code
- 100-199 : Informational
- 200-299 : Success
    - 200 : ok
    - 201 : created
    - 204 : no content
- 300-399 : Redirection
- 400-499 : Client erros
    - 400 : Bad requests
    - 404 : not found
    - 409 : conflict
- 500-599 : Server error
    - 500 : Internal server error

## Headers(Respose Metadata)
- Content Type: content format
- Content Length: size of the content
- Expires : when is this invalid

## Content 
- HTML, CSS, XML, JSON
- Blobs etc.

# Note 1:
- for routing , in controller file there will be done this:-
- [Route("api/controllername")]

# Note 2:
- The http method will be get/post/...that will be written in the endpoint of the action method.
- In CRUD operations - for deleting we have to delete something by their id.
- There is a function to get the immediate date and time - DateTime.Now

# Understanding DNS, IP, and Domain Names:
- DNS, IP addresses, and domain names work together to enable internet communication.
 DNS translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses, which are used by computers to
  identify each other on the network. Domain names are the addresses we use to access websites (like www.example.com), while IP addresses are the numerical addresses that computers use to communicate. 

## Domain Name:
- A user-friendly name for a website or server, like "google.com" or "amazon.com"

## IP Address:
- A unique numerical address assigned to each device connected to the internet, like "192.0.2.1". 

## DNS (Domain Name System):
- The "phone book" of the internet, translating domain names into IP addresses. 

## How it works:
- When you type a domain name into a browser, the DNS system finds the corresponding IP address 
and the browser uses that address to connect to the website. 

# How browsers and servers communicate:
- Web browsers and servers communicate using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a request-response protocol. 
The browser acts as a client, sending requests (like GET or POST) to the server. The server then processes these requests and 
sends back responses, which the browser uses to render web pages. This communication relies on the underlying TCP/IP network stack. 

# RESTful principles and how APIs work:
- A RESTful API (or REST API) is an application programming interface (API) that follows the principles of Representational
 State Transfer (REST), a software architectural style, to enable communication between client and server applications 
 over the internet, often using HTTP requests.

## Key RESTful Principles::
- `Statelessness`:Each request from the client must contain all the information needed for the server to process it, 
and the server does not store any information about previous requests. 
- `Client-Server Architecture`: The client and server are separate entities that interact through a defined interface (API). 
- `Uniform Interface`: RESTful APIs use a consistent set of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URIs to interact with resources. 
- `Layered System`:The API is structured in layers, allowing for modularity and scalability. 


# How APIs Work:
## 1. Client Request:
- The client (e.g., an application) initiates a request to the server, using an HTTP method and a specific URL (endpoint). 
## 2. Server Processing:
- The server receives the request, authenticates the client, and processes the request based on its logic. 
## 3. Server Response:
- The server generates a response, including the requested resource or status information, and sends it back to the client. 
## 4. Client Response Handling:
- The client receives the response and processes it accordingly. 

# Client-Server Architecture:
- Client-server architecture is a network model where clients request services or resources from servers, which then process 
those requests and provide the requested information. 

## How it Works:
1. Client Request:
A client sends a request to a server for a specific service or data.
2. Server Processing:
The server receives the request and processes it, potentially accessing its own resources or other servers.
3. Server Response:
The server sends a response back to the client, which could be data, an acknowledgement, or an error message.
4. Client Reception:
The client receives the response and displays it to the user or takes further action based on it. 

# Session:
- Session is an end-to-end encrypted messenger that minimises sensitive metadata, designed and built for people 
who want absolute privacy and freedom from any form of surveillance.

# Cookie:
- HTTP Cookie is a computer file with information in it, that is sent to the central server each time, a particular person
uses a network or internet.

# Authentication:
Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity before granting them access to a system or resource. It ensures that only authorized individuals gain access, protecting sensitive information and systems. In simpler terms, it's about confirming that a user is who they claim to be. 

# JSON vs. XML (Data Formats):
- `Syntax`: JSON uses a key-value pair structure with arrays, while XML uses a markup language with tags to represent data. 
- `Data Structure`: JSON is data-oriented, focusing on the data itself, while XML is document-oriented, allowing for more detailed descriptions and metadata. 
- `Size and Speed`: JSON is generally more compact and faster to parse than XML. 
- `Metadata`: XML provides better support for metadata and data validation through schemas. 
- `Parsing`: JSON is easier to parse with JavaScript and other languages. 
- `Use Cases`: JSON is often used in web APIs and data transfer between applications, while XML is suitable for data interchange between systems and storing complex data with metadata. 

# Caching:
- Caching, both at the browser (client-side) and server-side, is a technique used to improve website performance by storing copies of frequently accessed data in temporary storage locations. This reduces the need to constantly re-fetch data from the origin server,
resulting in faster load times and a smoother user experience. 

## Browser Caching (Client-Side Caching):
### Definition:
- Stores copies of website resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) on the user's device for faster loading on subsequent visits. 
### Benefits:
- Reduces page load times. 
- Improves the overall user experience. 
- Decreases the number of requests sent to the server. 
### Drawbacks:
- Can lead to outdated content if not properly managed. 
- Limited control for developers over what gets cached. 
### Examples: 
- LocalStorage, SessionStorage, browser cache. 

## Server-Side Caching:
### Definition:
- Stores data on the web server (or a dedicated caching layer like Memcached or Redis) to reduce load on the origin server. 
### Benefits:
- Improves website speed and performance. 
- Reduces the load on the server. 
- Scales better for high-traffic websites. 
### Drawbacks:
- More complex to configure than browser caching. 
- Requires knowledge of caching layers and server configurations. 
### Examples:
- Memcached, Redis, Varnish.
