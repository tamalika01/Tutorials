# Session:
- session is a state that is used to store and retrieve values of a user.
- It helps to identify requests from the same browser during a time period (session). It is used to store value for the particular time session. By default, ASP.NET session state is enabled for all ASP.NET applications.

# Cookie:
- ASP.NET Cookie is a small bit of text that is used to store user-specific information. This information can be read by the web application whenever user visits the site.
- When a user requests for a web page, web server sends not just a page, but also a cookie containing the date and time. This cookie stores in a folder on the user's hard disk.
- There are two ways to store cookies in ASP.NET application.
     - Cookies collection
     - HttpCookie

# JWT Authentication
- JWT (JSON Web Token) Bearer Authentication is commonly utilized for APIs. While it operates similarly to cookie authentication, the identity provider issues a JWT or tokens upon a successful authentication. 

# CORS:
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy (SOP).

## How to prevent CORS-based attacks
- Proper configuration of cross-origin requests
- Only allow trusted sites
- Avoid whitelisting null
- Avoid wildcards in internal networks
- CORS is not a substitute for server-side security policies
