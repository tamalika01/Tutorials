# Session:
- session is a state that is used to store and retrieve values of a user.
- It helps to identify requests from the same browser during a time period (session). It is used to store value for the particular time session. By default, ASP.NET session state is enabled for all ASP.NET applications.

# Cookie:
- ASP.NET Cookie is a small bit of text that is used to store user-specific information. This information can be read by the web application whenever user visits the site.
- When a user requests for a web page, web server sends not just a page, but also a cookie containing the date and time. This cookie stores in a folder on the user's hard disk.
- There are two ways to store cookies in ASP.NET application.
     - Cookies collection
     - HttpCookie

# JWT Authentication
- JWT (JSON Web Token) Bearer Authentication is commonly utilized for APIs. While it operates similarly to cookie authentication, the identity provider issues a JWT or tokens upon a successful authentication. 

# CORS:
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy (SOP).

## How to prevent CORS-based attacks
- Proper configuration of cross-origin requests
- Only allow trusted sites
- Avoid whitelisting null
- Avoid wildcards in internal networks
- CORS is not a substitute for server-side security policies

# Authentication:
- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or other entity.

## Importance of Authentication:
- ` Security:` Prevents unauthorized access to systems, networks, and data.
- `Data Protection:` Safeguards sensitive information from breaches and misuse.
- `Fraud Prevention:` Helps identify and prevent fraudulent activities.
- `Trust:` Ensures users can rely on the systems and services they use. 
### Examples:
- Logging into your email account by entering your username and password.
- Using a fingerprint to unlock your phone.
- Receiving a one-time code via SMS to complete an online purchase.
- Using a smart card to access a secure building. 

## 1. Username and Password Authentication:
- The user submits their username and password to the server.
- The server verifies these credentials (typically by checking a hashed password in the database).
- If valid, the server considers the user authenticated, and may:
   - Start a session (storing a session ID on the server).
   - Return a cookie to the client to maintain the session state for subsequent requests. 

## Pros:
- Simple and easy to implement.
- Works well for traditional web applications using server-side sessions.

## Cons:
- Requires session management on the server (can become a bottleneck with many users).
- Susceptible to session hijacking if cookies are not secured properly.


## 2. JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication:
- JWT authentication is a stateless authentication mechanism where a user is given a token after logging in, and this token is sent with each request to verify the user's identity.

## How it works:
- The user sends their username and password to the server.
- If valid, the server generates a JWT token (which contains encoded user data and is signed with a secret).
- The client stores the token (usually in localStorage or sessionStorage).
- For each request, the client includes the token in the Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`
- The server verifies the token signature and decodes the payload to authenticate the user.

## Pros:
- `Stateless:` No need to store sessions on the server.
- Scales well across multiple servers or microservices.
- Can contain user data (claims) in the payload, reducing the need for repeated DB calls.

## Cons:
- More complex to implement securely (need to handle token expiration, refresh tokens, etc.).
- If a token is compromised, it can be used until it expires unless explicitly revoked.
