# Microservices

## Monolithic Architecture: 
- single unit, auth payment listing

## Issues:
### Redeployment
- If we do any change in auth, then only auth cannot be redeployed, we have to redeploy the whole application.
### Scaling Limitations
- If doing the sign up, login, any error occurs then we have to scale up the full aplications not only the auth.
### Lots of dependencies
- If we use a version in auth, and if the package needed in listing then we have to use the same package version used in auth, 
because this is the single unit application.

# Microservice Architecture
- UI- Api gateway- auth, payment, listings
- Independent development, seperate codebase, independent deployment - all are loosly coupled.

## Benefits
- Independent Deployment, Flexible scalling, Technology flexibility.

## How microservices interact with each other?
- 1. Synchronous communication 
- 2. Asynchronous communication

## Disadvantage 
- complex
- management overhead,
- high infrastructure costs.
