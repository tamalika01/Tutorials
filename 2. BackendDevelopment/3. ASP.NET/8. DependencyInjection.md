# Dependency Injection
## What is dependency?
- when one class depends on another class for properties or methods
- example: class A depends on class B
- ```java
  class B{
    void Method1(){
        //Do stuff
    }
  }
  class A{
    void Method2(){
        B obj = new B();
        obj.Method1();
    }
  }
  ```
## What is coupling?
- A measure of how  connected two classes are
- Dependency between classes increases coupling.
- High coupling increases the cost of software.
- A good software will have low coupling.

## What is dependency injection?
- A design pattern to reduce coupling between classes.
- Provides dependencies to classes without high coupling.
- Can be impemented without any third party library.

## Types:
- Constructor injection
- Property injection
- Method injection

## Constructor Injection
- provide dependency at the time of initialization as a parameter in constructor.

## Property Injection
- provide dependency as a property to the class after initializing it.

## Method Injection
- provide dependency directly in the method needing it as a parameter.
