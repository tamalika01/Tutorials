## Routing
- Routing is a pattern matching system.
- Routing maps incoming request (from browser) to a particular resouce (controler and action method).
- domain.com/Home/About
- domain.com/about-us
- We define route for each action method.
- All the routes are stored in the round table.
- Each incoming requests is mapped to the round table
- If a URL match is found then requests goes to related controller action method.
- If a URL is not found then applictions return to 404 page,

### Types:
- Traditional way
- Attribute routing(Available in MVC)

### Traditional way of Routing:
- Routing is a pattern matching system for URL that maps incoming request to controller action method.
- We set all routes in RouteConfig file.
- RouteConfig is available in App_Start folder.
- We need to register all the routes to make them operational.

  #### Route:
  - Route is a pattern for a particular url.
  - It needs following parameters.
       - Name
       - Pattern
       - Default Value
       - Constraint(if any)

### Attribute Routing:
- All the concepts are just like traditional approach.
- But here we define all the routes as attributes.

# Pass data from View to Controller
- Using parameter
- Using request
- Using form collection
- Strongly binding
- Using JS etc

## Using parameter:
```java
// In controller folder
[HttpPost]
public string PostUsingParameters(string firstName, string lastName)
{
   return "From parameters - " + firstName + ", " + lastName;
}
```

## Using request
```java
// In controller folder
[HttpPost]
public string PostUsingRequest()
{
  string firstName = Request["firstName"];
  string lastName = Request["lastName"];

  return "From request - " + firstName + ", " + lastName;
}
```
## Using form collection
```java
public string PostUsingFormCollection(FormCollection form)
{
   string firstName = form["firstName"];
   string lastName = form["lastName"];

   return "From form collection - " + firstName + ", " + lastName;
}
```
