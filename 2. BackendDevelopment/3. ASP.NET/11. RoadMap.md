# ASP.NET Roadmap
# 1. Understanding How the Web Works (Fundamentals)
- `Objective`: Gain a solid understanding of how the web works at a fundamental level.

## Basics of the Web:

- What is HTTP/HTTPS? (Requests, Responses, Status Codes)
- Understanding DNS, IP, and Domain Names
- How browsers and servers communicate
- RESTful principles and how APIs work
## Key Concepts:

- Client-Server Architecture
- Cookies, Sessions, and Authentication
- JSON vs. XML (Data Formats)
- Caching (Browser and Server-Side)

## Tools:

- Postman (API Testing)
- Browser DevTools (Inspecting Network Requests)

# 2. Learning ASP.NET Core
- `Objective`: Learn to develop RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core.

## Getting Started:

- Setting up the development environment (Visual Studio/VS Code)
- Understanding the ASP.NET Core project structure
- Middleware and the Request-Response Pipeline

 ## Building RESTful APIs:

- Creating Controllers and Actions
- Routing (Attribute Routing and Conventional Routing)
 Model Binding and Validation
- Returning JSON Responses

## Database Integration:

- Setting up Entity Framework Core
- Code-First vs. Database-First Approach
- Performing CRUD Operations with EF Core
- Using LINQ for querying data

## API Documentation:

- Adding Swagger/OpenAPI for API Documentation
- Customizing Swagger UI
- Adding XML Comments for better documentation

## API Versioning:

- Why API Versioning is important
- Implementing API Versioning in ASP.NET Core
- Managing multiple API versions

## Securing APIs:

- Authentication and Authorization
- Using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Role-Based and Policy-Based Authorization
- Securing Endpoints with HTTPS
- Protecting APIs from common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, CSRF, XSS)

# 3. Advanced Topics
- `Objective`: Deepen your knowledge and prepare for real-world scenarios.

## Performance Optimization:

- Caching (In-Memory, Distributed)
- Asynchronous Programming in C#
- Optimizing Database Queries

## Testing:

- Unit Testing with xUnit or NUnit
- Mocking Dependencies (Moq)
- Integration Testing for APIs

## Deployment:

- Hosting ASP.NET Core APIs on IIS, Azure, or Docker
- CI/CD Basics (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)

## Real-World Practices:

- Implementing Logging with Serilog or NLog
- Using Configuration and Secrets Management
- Monitoring APIs with tools like Application Insights

# 4. Hands-On Projects
- `Objective`: Apply what you've learned by building real-world applications.

# Project Ideas:

- Build a Task Management API (CRUD operations, JWT Authentication)
- Develop an E-commerce API (Product Catalog, Cart, Orders)
- Create a Blogging Platform API (Posts, Comments, User Roles)

# Focus Areas:

- Use Swagger for API documentation
- Implement versioning and secure the APIs
- Integrate a database and optimize queries
