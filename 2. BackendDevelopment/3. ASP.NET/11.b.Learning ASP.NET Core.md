# 2. Learning ASP.NET Core
- `Objective`: Learn to develop RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core.

# Understanding the ASP.NET Core project structure:
 
## 📁 1. Program.cs
- This is the entry point of the application.
- Sets up the web host and configures services and the request pipeline.

## 📁 2. Startup.cs (optional in .NET 6+, but common in older versions)
- Used to configure services (ConfigureServices) and the app’s request pipeline (Configure).
- In .NET 6+, this logic is often moved into Program.cs.

## 📁 3. appsettings.json
- Stores configuration settings such as database connection strings, logging, and environment-specific settings.
- You can have multiple versions like appsettings.Development.json.

## 📁 4. Properties/launchSettings.json
- Contains settings used when launching the app during development (e.g., which browser to open, environment variables).

## 📁 5. Controllers/
- Contains controller classes that handle HTTP requests and return responses.
- Follows the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller).

## 📁 6. Models/
- Contains classes that represent the data or business logic layer of the application.
- Often includes validation attributes, entity classes, etc.

## 📁 7. Views/
- Contains Razor .cshtml files that render the UI.
- Folders usually match the controller names, and contain view files like Index.cshtml, Create.cshtml, etc.

## 📁 8. wwwroot/
- The web root folder where static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) are stored.
- Files here are publicly accessible by the browser.

## 📁 9. Middleware
- Custom logic that can inspect or modify HTTP requests/responses.
- Typically added via app.Use...() in Program.cs.

## 📁 10. Dependencies
- Contains NuGet packages and project references.
- Managed via the .csproj file.

# Middleware and the Request-Response Pipeline
- Middleware is an application component that handles requests and responses as they pass through the request pipeline in an ASP.NET Core application. A middleware component is an individual unit within that pipeline, responsible for performing a specific task, such as logging, authentication, or error handling.
