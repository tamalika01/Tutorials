# Validation
- Validation is used to filter the user input.
- There are different attributes to validate the input
- EX- 
    - to check if input is required
    - to check like min length
    - to check like max length
    - To check like email etc.

## Types of Validation
- Client side validation
- Server side validation

- client(validate input) ===> server(validate input)

### Validation attributes
- Required
- MinLength
- MaxLength
- Email etc..

# Validation Summary:
- `@Html.ValidationSummary()` - helps to show the error on the top.

# Custom Validation:
- In every application you have your own logic. So you may have your own requirements for 
validating a particular field. And if that requirement is not fullfilled by existing validation attribute
then you have to create your own validation attribute.
- Creating a Custom Validation is very easy in MVC.

## Creating Custom Validation
- We have to implement  `ValidationAttribute` class.
- `ValidationAttribute` is available in `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace .
- Then, We have to override `IsValid` method.

## There can be multiple views or layout in MVC.

## Section in Layout:
- `@RenderSection("SectionName", required : true)`
- To use that space from View we use `@section`
- ```java
  @section sectionName{
    //Code goes here
  }
  ```

# @RenderPage in MVC:
- We use to show a view in another view.
