# Introduction
- `ASP.NET MVC` is a powerful web application framework that is designed to make it easy to build than make data-driven web applications. It provides developers with a number of advantages over traditional ASP.NET web forms including, better separation of concerns, more control over HTML and URL generation and improved testability.
- ASP.Net Core is an open-source and a cross-platform framework for building cloud-based applications, such as Web Apps, IoT apps and mobile back-ends.

# Feauters
- Cross Platform support
- High Performance
- Less Code
- Easy Maintainence
- Cloud Based Application Development Support

# MVC
- stands for Model, View and Controller
- It separets the application into three parts- model, view and controller

# Model
- Model represents the shape of the data.
- A model is a class that represents the data and business logic of the application.
- Responsible for defining the data entities, also validating the input and performing the database operations.
-Used in conjunction with data access technology such as Entity Framework, Entity Framework Core, LINQ, or ado.net as well.

# View
- View in MVC is basically a user interface which is responsible for rendering the user interface of the application.
- It displays the model data to the user and also allows them to modify them.
- View in ASP.NET MVC is HTML, CSS, and some special syntax called resource syntax that makes it easy to communicate with the model and the controller itself.
-  Enable the JavaScript or you can make a single page application by enabling Angular or React into your application as well. 

# Controller
- Responsible for handling the user input and updating the model and view that makes the interaction between the model and view.
- It is the component that handles the request from the client.
- Performs all the necessary options, which is also known as the CRUD operation.
- Controller is defined as a class that inherits from the base class controller in ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET core MVC. 
-  Includes the action method that corresponds the user request and perform the operations onto the model.

# Action Methods:
- A action is a method that responds to user actin/activity.
- Any method in a controller which has public access modifier and return a particular action type as a return type that is known as an action method. 
- Action method must be public, cannot be overloaded, cannot be a static method.
- ```java
  public ViewResult Message(){
    return View(); // right click on View, then add to view, then razor empty, then add a html tag <p>some message</p> which will show in view
  }
  ```

# Action Results:
- MVC framework includes various Result classes which can be returned from an action method.
- Each ActionResult class is a base class of all the result classes.
- Result Classes represents various types of responses such as Html file, JSON, string etc.

# Razor View Engine:
- It is responsible for producing `Html response` when invoked by the controller action method.
- `Controller Action` method returns some type of responses which are called as Action Results.
- The ViewResult is the ActionResult which produces the HTML responses.
- The ViewResults are produced by the View Engine like Razor View Engine.

# Razor Syntax:
- To escape an @ symbol in razor markup, use a second @ symbol.
- `<p>@@Username</p>`

# Forms:
- Forms allows user to submit the data to server.
- which can then be used to create, update or delete records or to perform some oter actions.
- they can be created using HTML helpers, which are methods that generate HTML code that can be used to display and interact with forms.
- The moment you see the web page over the browser, that is a GET request, but the moment you click on the submit button that is a POST action.
- Two types: Weekly typed, Strongly Typed

## Weekly Typed Forms
-  it refers to a way of handling the form data where the model classes do not interact with the forms.
- the form data is accessed as a collection of key and value pair where the key can be ID or name.
-  The value is the associated property such as username is the key associated to the value that user enters. 
-  The developer can access using the Request object, which provide access to the form collection.

## Strongly Typed Forms
-  it refers to the way of handling form where the data or attribute is associated to the model.
-  this allows developers to define a data model that corresponds to the structure of the form data.
- Developers can create a data model using a class.

# Model Binding
-  Model binding is the way that extracts the data from an HTTP request, whether it is a GET request or navigated request for the subsequent request coming from, and provide them to the controller action method parameters.
- The action method parameters may be simple types, just like integers, string, complex types such as any object, student, order, product.

# Middleware Request Pipeline
- Here, requests are processed beginning with request and ends with response.
- pipeline specifies how the application should respond to the HTTP request.
- request arriving from the browser goes through the pipeline and back.
- the individual components that make up the pipeine are called middleware.
- some middleware are: Authentication, static file, routing, session, Exception handling, Cross origin resource sharing(CORS),
HTTPS redirection.

# Dependency Injection
- used to achieve loosly coupling between objects, so that applications can be maintained easily manner.
- Dot Net runtime engine automatically injects objects of dependency class.
- It injects mainly constructors of the controllers.
- Thus, making the job of the developer very easily.
- The concept of DI arises from a principle software design called Dependency Inversion Principal.

# Object Relational Mapping(ORM)
- It is a way to align programming code with database structures.
- It uses metadata descriptors to create a layer between the programming language and relational database.

# SOA(Service Oriented Architecture)
- It defines a way to make software components reusable after interfaces.
- It uses common communication standards to speed up the service integration in the application as well. 

# REST(Representational State Transfer)
- It is an architectural style not a protocol.
-  It's an API which is referred to as in tracked or the intermediator between an information provider and the information user.
-  Restful services are based on HTTP protocol which is Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
