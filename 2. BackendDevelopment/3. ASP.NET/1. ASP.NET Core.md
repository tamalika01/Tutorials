# Introduction
- `ASP.NET MVC` is a powerful web application framework that is designed to make it easy to build than make data-driven web applications. It provides developers with a number of advantages over traditional ASP.NET web forms including, better separation of concerns, more control over HTML and URL generation and improved testability.
- ASP.Net Core is an open-source and a cross-platform framework for building cloud-based applications, such as Web Apps, IoT apps and mobile back-ends.

# Feauters
- Cross Platform support
- High Performance
- Less Code
- Easy Maintainence
- Cloud Based Application Development Support

# MVC
- stands for Model, View and Controller
- It separets the application into three parts- model, view and controller

# Model
- Model represents the shape of the data.
- A model is a class that represents the data and business logic of the application.
- Responsible for defining the data entities, also validating the input and performing the database operations.
-Used in conjunction with data access technology such as Entity Framework, Entity Framework Core, LINQ, or ado.net as well.

# View
- View in MVC is basically a user interface which is responsible for rendering the user interface of the application.
- It displays the model data to the user and also allows them to modify them.
- View in ASP.NET MVC is HTML, CSS, and some special syntax called resource syntax that makes it easy to communicate with the model and the controller itself.
-  Enable the JavaScript or you can make a single page application by enabling Angular or React into your application as well. 

# Controller
- Responsible for handling the user input and updating the model and view that makes the interaction between the model and view.
- It is the component that handles the request from the client.
- Performs all the necessary options, which is also known as the CRUD operation.
- Controller is defined as a class that inherits from the base class controller in ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET core MVC. 
-  Includes the action method that corresponds the user request and perform the operations onto the model.

# Action Methods:
- A action is a method that responds to user actin/activity.
- Any method in a controller which has public access modifier and return a particular action type as a return type that is known as an action method. 
- Action method must be public, cannot be overloaded, cannot be a static method.
- ```java
  public ViewResult Message(){
    return View(); // right click on View, then add to view, then razor empty, then add a html tag <p>some message</p> which will show in view
  }
  ```

# Action Results:
- MVC framework includes various Result classes which can be returned from an action method.
- Each ActionResult class is a base class of all the result classes.
- Result Classes represents various types of responses such as Html file, JSON, string etc.

# Razor View Engine:
- It is responsible for producing `Html response` when invoked by the controller action method.
- `Controller Action` method returns some type of responses which are called as Action Results.
- The ViewResult is the ActionResult which produces the HTML responses.
- The ViewResults are produced by the View Engine like Razor View Engine.
- ![Razor View Engine](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/razor-view-engine-in-asp-net-mvc-5/Images/image02.png)

# Razor Syntax:
- To escape an @ symbol in razor markup, use a second @ symbol.
- `<p>@@Username</p>`

# Forms:
- Forms allows user to submit the data to server.
- which can then be used to create, update or delete records or to perform some oter actions.
- they can be created using HTML helpers, which are methods that generate HTML code that can be used to display and interact with forms.
- The moment you see the web page over the browser, that is a GET request, but the moment you click on the submit button that is a POST action.
- Two types: Weekly typed, Strongly Typed

## Weekly Typed Forms
-  it refers to a way of handling the form data where the model classes do not interact with the forms.
- the form data is accessed as a collection of key and value pair where the key can be ID or name.
-  The value is the associated property such as username is the key associated to the value that user enters. 
-  The developer can access using the Request object, which provide access to the form collection.

## Strongly Typed Forms
-  it refers to the way of handling form where the data or attribute is associated to the model.
-  this allows developers to define a data model that corresponds to the structure of the form data.
- Developers can create a data model using a class.

# Model Binding
-  Model binding is the way that extracts the data from an HTTP request, whether it is a GET request or navigated request for the subsequent request coming from, and provide them to the controller action method parameters.
- The action method parameters may be simple types, just like integers, string, complex types such as any object, student, order, product.

# Middleware Request Pipeline
- Here, requests are processed beginning with request and ends with response.
- pipeline specifies how the application should respond to the HTTP request.
- request arriving from the browser goes through the pipeline and back.
- the individual components that make up the pipeine are called middleware.
- some middleware are: Authentication, static file, routing, session, Exception handling, Cross origin resource sharing(CORS),
HTTPS redirection.

# Dependency Injection
- used to achieve loosly coupling between objects, so that applications can be maintained easily manner.
- Dot Net runtime engine automatically injects objects of dependency class.
- It injects mainly constructors of the controllers.
- Thus, making the job of the developer very easily.
- The concept of DI arises from a principle software design called Dependency Inversion Principal.

# Object Relational Mapping(ORM)
- It is a way to align programming code with database structures.
- It uses metadata descriptors to create a layer between the programming language and relational database.

# SOA(Service Oriented Architecture)
- It defines a way to make software components reusable after interfaces.
- It uses common communication standards to speed up the service integration in the application as well. 

# REST(Representational State Transfer)
- It is an architectural style not a protocol.
-  It's an API which is referred to as in tracked or the intermediator between an information provider and the information user.
-  Restful services are based on HTTP protocol which is Hypertext Transfer Protocol.


# .NET Architecture Components
* There are many frameworks included in .NET 6.0
    * A framework are just predefined classes and libraries to help us start an application
    * One framework we will be using in the future is ASP.NET (Used to create Web Apis)
## SDK vs Runtime
### SDK
* Software Development Kit
* Includes everything we need to build and run a .NET application
    * Such as Command-Line interface commands to create our projects as well as a bunch of other functionalities
* SDK includes Runtime as well why? Well when you develop an application you of course need to run it to be able to test if everything is working properly
### Runtime
* It includes all the resources we need to run existing .NET application
* A lot less storage required to download and install
* Mostly useful for end-users (people who will be using our application)

# Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)
* This is the  infrastructure of .NET on how it is able to write your application in numerous programming language beyond C# and for your application to be run on any operating system
## General structure of the .Net
* .Net - when you instal .Net sdk you get
    * **CLR**
        * CLI - Common Language Infrastructure (**.Net Languages**)
            * CLS
            * CTS
        * Garbage Collector - dispose unused objects of a program
        * JIT Compiler - to compile your IL to machine native code (binary code), its very fast
    * **Libraries**
    
## CLS
* Common Language Specification
* It has defined rules and restrictions that every langauge must follow for it to be able to run the .NET framework. Eg rules like Arrays index should start from 0, the langauges should be OOP.
* Essentially a standardization to make sure a language won't do anything that will make it incompatible with .NET framework
## [CTS](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/blogs/what-are-cts-and-cls-in-net)
* Common Type System
* Provides a library of the basic value data types
* It is a standardization of data types to ensure every language will follow the same datatype
    * Ex: int in C# is the same 32-bit memory as the int in Visual Basic
* Helps create **Language Interoperability**
    * Fancy way of saying .NET has the capability to develop application using two or more programming languages
    * You can create apps using Visual Basic, C#, J# (Java-like language that can run in .NET), etc.
        * NEVER SAY JAVA ITSELF J# IS NOT JAVA
## VES
* Run-time system of CLI that provides all the tools it needs to be able to execute your application
### CLR
* Common Language Runtime implements VES so anything in VES, CLR also has it plus more
* Essentially, it is .NET's version of VES
* Run-time environment that provides services that make the development process easier
* Some servies it includes:
    * Automatic memory management (older languages you have to manually release unused resources)
    * JIT compilation (Just-inTime compilation that involves compliation during execution for optimization)
        * It just means any new compile code gets executed immediately, it doesn't have to wait until your entire code has been compiled to run your app
    * Exception handling support
    * Security against vulnerable code, like you cannot run a malicious .net code in your machine taken from internet.

# Application Architecture
* A way for us to group our code just like how we group our files by putting them in folders
## Separation of Concern
* The fancy way of saying it is a concept of organizing our code
* We want our code to follow a certain theme and all the code are grouped together to do a certain functionality
* We do this by leveraging classes and other grouping mechanisms to group code and logic together
* This is a first but **important** step to writing readable, extendable, and maintainable code.

## Classes
* They are the building blocks of your code
* They are the blueprints to creating objects that you process in your program
## Namespace
* Logical grouping of classes that follow a certain theme of functionality
* To utilize the classes located in a different namespace, you must use the 'using' keyword
## Project
* They contain all the files that are compiled into an executable, library, website, etc.
* There are different types of projects that are responsible at creating one thing like how a console project is a great starting point of your application while class library projects are great at adding more customize functionalities you want in your application
* A way you know a folder is a project if you notice an important file usually dictated as **(folder name).csproj** they contain key information that will configures your project and also what your project will depend on
## Assembly
* They contain all the files that are actual executables
* These files will differ depending on what operating system you are using but as for windows, it will be .exe and .dll files
* If you open the auto-generated bin folders, you can file the assembly files located there
* **So main difference with projects are that projects are the .cs files and .csproj and other configurations while assembly is the actual files that gets run since that is what your operating system understands**
## Solution
* The final grouping mechanism in that it will group multiple projects as one application
* They are the final packaging of your application
